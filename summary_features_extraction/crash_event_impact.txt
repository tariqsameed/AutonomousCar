V2 was traveling at the speed of 56kph  (35mph) and spun clockwise, and then continued forward while V1 hit V2 again in the left side before coming to final rest on the property of the north/east corner of the intersection.
The impact also caused V1 to spin counter-clockwise and continued forward.
V1 was driven to a safer place after impact off to the side of the road.
Only V2 had to be removed from the scene due to damage.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe driver of V1 did not suffer any injuries as a result of the impact.
The reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see).\r\r\n\r\r\nV2 was traveling at approximately 56kph (35mph) through the intersection before it was struck by V1.
After realizing a crash was about to occur, the driver of V2 hit the brakes and steered to the right in an attempt to avoid the collision.

\r\r\nV2 struck V1 on the right rear door and down the side toward the right front door.
The impact caused V1 to be pushed up and spun counter clockwise by almost 180 degrees, in the intersection.
When V1 spun around, it was reported that it struck V3.
Shortly after the initial impact, V2 caught fire, probably starting at or near the battery, because of the angle of the crash for V2.
Shortly after the impact, this vehicle caught fire, which was believed to have started at the battery.
After V1 was hit it spun around and hit V3.

At the point of the first impact, the roadway was level.
The front left of V1 struck the right side front of V2.
This impact rotated V2 in a counterclockwise direction, causing the left front of V2 to strike a parked vehicle to its left, a 2004 Ford Focus.
After striking V2, V1 struck two other parked vehicles on the right and then continued westbound on the roadway.
V1 then departed the roadway to the right and struck some bushes and trees.
The police speculated that after the initial impact, the driver of V1 kept her foot on the accelerator, thinking it was the brake.
The driver of V1 also told police that after the first impact, the air bag deployed and the car went out of control.
The passenger in the parked vehicle reported this, and the hard impact to V2 verified this.

As V2 entered the intersection, its left side was struck by the front right of V1.
The momentum of V1 pushed V2 off of the roadway and down the east/west roadway traveling westbound, coming to rest approximately 51.6m from impact in the eastbound lanes.
A witness who had been traveling behind V1 reported that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to impact.
The extent of damage to V2 and the post-impact trajectory of the vehicles supported the claim of excess speed, as the posted speed limit was 40 KMPH (25 MPH).

Vehicle two was pushed up several feet after the impact and incurred moderate damage.
It is believed that the driver was not wearing a seatbelt and his chin contacted the steering wheel Vehicle one was towed due to damages.
\r\r\n\r\r\nIt\'s the researcher\'s opinion that during rush hour the major roadway was very busy and at times congested and the driver, after making a right turn preoccupied traveling a bit faster then the speed limit made a sharp turn and contacted the rear of parked vehicle two.

After the initial impact, V2 left tire blew out causing it to pivot and rotate counter-clockwise and contact, with its right side, a fire hydrant located on the southeast curb of the intersection.
The impact caused the hydrant to dislodge and hit a woman sitting on her steps located on the curb area several feet from the corner.
\r\r\n\r\r\nMeanwhile, V1, after the initial impact, rotated counter-clockwise and was struck on its right side by the front of V3, a 1999 Ford Crown Victoria marked police cruiser, traveling eastbound.
However, a witness sitting on adjoining steps from the pedestrian struck by the hydrant, said the police were coming from everywhere traveling at a high rate of speed through the intersection without stopping for the traffic lights.

The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the eastbound lane and pushed V2 toward the westbound lane.
When V1 struck V2, and V2 came to a stop in the road partially in the westbound lane, the driver of V3 braked, with full ABS application, and tried to swerve to the right to avoid V2.
The front left of V3 struck the back right of V2.
The front left of V3 struck the left front and passenger area of V1.
The driver, who was 6\' tall and weighed almost 300 pounds, contacted and bent the steering wheel and was transported with incapacitating injuries to a local trauma center.
\r\r\n\r\r\nV2 came to rest slightly into the oncoming lane of traffic facing southeast, near the point of impacts.
V3 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions of V2, described by the driver as 50\' ahead of him in the fog, but the Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle, as this was a secondary impact.

V1 left the roadway on the left side and the front of V1struck a 30cm diameter tree 1.6 meters north of the road edge.
The top 5 meters of the tree broke off at impact and fell on the roof of the vehicle.
\r\r\n\r\r\nThe driver and passenger airbags deployed in the impact.
There were no atmospheric conditions or vehicle defects found to be related to this crash.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn summary, the crash occurred when the unlicensed and inexperienced driver of V1, who was traveling too fast for the ice-covered roadway, lost control, departed the roadway and struck a tree.

It then spun clockwise onto the inside shoulder where it struck the median guardrail with it\'s right rear and came to rest on the shoulder facing east.
I do believe that the reason he tracked the actions of v1 before the impact was because he drifted left out of his lane and quickly checked his side mirror to see if any traffic was there.
