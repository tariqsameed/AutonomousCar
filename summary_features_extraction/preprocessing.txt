This crash occurred on the southbound lanes of a five-lane undivided urban highway. There were three southbound lanes that included a left turn lane for the traffic signal-controlled intersection. Conditions were dark, but the roadway was illuminated and dry in the mid-evening hours on a weekend. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 48 KMPH (30 MPH) and the southbound lanes were straight and level. The crash occurred on a weekend during the hours of darkness.\n\nV1 was a 2002 Hyundai Accent 2-door hatchback driven by a 65-year old female. She was traveling in the first lane of travel, approaching a four-way intersection controlled by a traffic signal. V2, a 1997 Nissan Pathfinder was stopped for a red light in the same lane at the intersection ahead of V1. The driver of V1 stated that she looked to her left at a retail store while braking, thinking that V2 was quite a distance ahead of her. She estimated that she had enough room between her vehicle and V2 as she slowed down to the intersection. She stated she probably didn\'t apply enough braking force, and the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. The driver of V1 was wearing her lap and shoulder seatbelt.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when another vehicle was in her lane stopped at the intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as an external distraction. This was chosen because the operator of V1 stated that she was looking at a store to her left as she approached the rear of V2. She also stated that she thought that V2 was farther ahead of her than it actually was. Because of this, she was also coded as misjudging the gap distance to V2. Another associated factor coded to this driver was inadequate evasive action. By her own admission, she did not apply sufficient pressure to her brake pedal. The driver of V1 reported that she was taking four medications:  an unknown diabetes medication, a cholesterol-lowering medication, an anti-inflammatory, and an antidepressant. Only the antidepressant had the possible side effects of dizziness and tiredness. She did not wear glasses for driving. She stated she was two-third\'s deaf in both ears but could not afford hearing aids although her driving license had a restriction on it indicating that she should be wearing hearing aids. She was familiar with both her vehicle and the roadway. Police did not consider alcohol to be involved and ordered no tests.\n\nThe driver of V2 was a 23-year old male with a 29-year old passenger in the front right seat. Both driver and passenger stated they had minor injuries to the head/neck areas.  The driver stated that he was at the intersection waiting for the light to change with one hand on the gearshift and one hand on the steering wheel. He had one foot on the accelerator pedal and one foot on the clutch pedal thereby indicating his brake lights were not engaged, possibly an associated factor in this crash. The driver and occupant were both restrained by lap and shoulder belts.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was when another vehicle was in his lane, traveling in the same direction, but at a higher speed. The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of the V2 and he was not thought to have contributed to the crash. At the time of the crash, he was talking to his passenger about family matters while waiting for the traffic signal to change to green. This conversation was not thought to have had an impact on the crash, as the driver was engaging in no driving activity at the time. The driver was in good health and did not take any medications. He was familiar with both his vehicle and the roadway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

The crash occurred in the southbound center lane of a three lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 89 KMPH (55 MPH).  There were two lanes southbound with a right turn only lane into a side road.  The roadway curved to the left with a radius of 225 meters and a superelevation of 3.2%. The roadway had a -2.3% grade. There were numerous highway signs advising that the roadway ahead was closed.  There was also a large illuminated sign at the road closure itself.  The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this weekday afternoon crash.\n\n     V1, a 1993 Chevrolet Blazer, was traveling south in the center (straight) lane approaching the intersection.  A large box truck pulled out from the intersecting street to turn left and in doing so blocked the \xe2\x80\x9cRoad Closed\xe2\x80\x9d sign from the driver of V1\'s view.  As the box truck completed the turn, the driver of V1 observed the sign, braked and steered right.  V1 went off the right side of the roadway rotating clockwise and struck a w-beam guardrail with its front.

\n\n     The crash occurred on a level four lane undivided roadway at a four-leg intersection controlled by a traffic signal.  The posted speed limit was 35 MPH (56 KPH).  It was raining, the roadway was wet and it was daylight at the time of this weekday morning crash.\n\n     V1, a 1998 Ford Contour, was traveling west exiting a parking lot driveway controlled by a flashing red light.  V2, a 2000 Dodge Durango, was traveling north in the second lane of the main road approaching the intersection.  V1 entered the intersection to turn left and was struck in the left side by the front of V2.  V1 was rotated counterclockwise, across the southbound lanes and came to rest off the road facing in a southeasterly direction.  V2 drove off the road to the right and stopped in a parking lot.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.\n\n     The Ford Contour (V1) was driven by a belted 69 year old female who was transported, treated for fractured ribs and released from a local hospital.  She stated that she had just left the feed store and was waiting to pull out to make a left hand turn.  She indicated that she had been stopped for more than 10 seconds prior to proceeding and waited until other traffic had a red light as she always did.

She had a hearing deficiency and was wearing a hearing aid at the time of the crash.  She considered herself in fair health.\n\n     The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was false assumption of other\'s actions.  This was chosen because her statement "all the other cars stopped" led her to believe he would stop also.  It should be noted that this driver had a flashing red light; while the main road had steady lights and it is possible the light had just changed for V2.  An associated factor coded to this driver was the use of prescription medications.  She was taking twelve medications: (a) a calcium channel blocker with possible side effects of dizziness, (b) a beta blocker with mild or uncommon side effects, (c) 2 high blood pressure medications with possible side effects of drowsiness, dizziness or fatigue, (d) a allergy medication with possible side effects of drowsiness or fatigue, (e) a cholesterol medication, (f) 2 stomach medications, (g) a pain medication with the possible side effect of drowsiness, (h) an anti-depressant with possible side effects of sedation, blurred vision, confusion and sensitivity to bright light, (i) a glaucoma medication with a possible side effect of blurred vision and (j) an unknown medication.\n\n     The Dodge Durango (V2) was driven by a belted 61-year-old male who was not injured.  The right front seat belted 62-year-old male passenger also was not injured.  Since this driver did not speak English limited information was obtained through a friend.  He indicated that he had been traveling at a normal speed for the roadway and that "she came out of nowhere".  He attempted to brake, but it was too late.  He was in good health, wore corrective lenses for an unknown condition and took no medications.  \n\n     The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was other vehicle encroaching from a driveway turning into opposite direction.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle.  It is possible that since this vehicle was traveling in the second lane approaching the intersection that traffic had been stopped in the right lane masking this driver\'s view of V1 as he entered the intersection.  No other associated factors were coded to the driver of the Durango and he was not thought to have contributed to the crash.\n\n     \n\n\n

The crash occurred in the southbound lane of a two-lane highway with a T-intersection.  Conditions were daylight and dry with cloudy skies in the mid-afternoon on a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 45 MPH and the southbound lane had a negative 2% grade.\n\nV1 was a 2003 Ford F350 super duty extended cab pick-up traveling south.  V2 was a 2004 Honda Civic coupe EX traveling south in front of V1.  V2 was braking and drifting to the right side of the road then tried to make an illegal left-handed U-turn.  V1 steered left but the front right corner of V1 struck the left side of V2.  V1 pushed V2 across the road coming to final rest just south of the impact.  V1 was facing south and V2 was facing north.  After coming to final rest, V2 drove up and over a median to get out of the way of oncoming traffic.\n\nV1 was driven by a 34-year-old male who sustained minor injuries and did not receive any medical attention.  He had stated that he was traveling south when he saw the other vehicle (V2) in front of him braking and drifting towards the right shoulder.  V2 then attempted to make a U-turn and the driver of V1 swerved left.  The driver of V1 was traveling less than 40 MPH.  V1 was driven from the scene.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V1 was when another vehicle encroached into his lane from an adjacent lane over the right lane line.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle.  An associated factor coded to the driver of V1 was a false assumption of the road user\'s actions.  The driver of V1 assumed that the driver of V2 was pulling off the road to the right and that he would stay there until he (V1) passed.  V2 had been braking on and off for some distance, and it is possible that the driver of V1 was getting \xe2\x80\x9cfed up\xe2\x80\x9d with V2\'s erratic behavior and wanted to believe that V2 was pulling off to the side of the road so that V1 could pass him.  The driver of V1 was wearing his prescription glasses that corrected a myopic (near-sighted) condition.  The driver of V1 was taking an allergy medication that had the possible side effect of drowsiness but this was not thought to have contributed to the crash.  He was familiar with the roadway and his vehicle.\n\nV2 was driven by a 17-year-old male who was treated by EMS at the scene for minor injuries but was not transported.  The driver of V2 stated that he was lost so he decided to move to the shoulder then make a U-turn.  He did not see the white truck behind him and was struck on the left side then pushed to final rest across the roadway.  He stated that he was traveling less than 5 MPH at the time of impact.  V2 was towed due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event was when V2 went over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was when V2 attempted to negotiate an illegal maneuver (U-turn) in front of V1.  Inattention was coded as an associated factor because the driver of V2 admitted that he was lost.  Consequently, he was thinking about this fact rather than focusing on the driving task.  Similarly, an exterior distraction was coded as an associated factor - he was busy looking around for his intended destination.  Inadequate surveillance was also coded as an associated factor - had the driver of V2 checked all his mirrors, he would have seen V1 approaching.  Finally, while the driver of V2 was familiar with his vehicle, this was the first time he had driven on this roadway.  This helps explain the fact that he was lost, looking around for his intended destination, and inattentive to the driving task.\n

Furthermore, her emotional and fatigue levels at the time of the crash, as well as the days preceding, were normal.\n\nThe driver of V2 was a 67-year-old male who did not need medical attention.  V2 was a 2002 Toyota Highlander, traveling east, that was stopped at a stop sign at the intersection.  The driver of V2 was supposed to cross over the perpendicular roadway that V1 was traveling.  Upon realization of the impending crash, the driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by steering his vehicle to the left.  With this maneuver, the driver unfortunately could not prevent this crash.  This vehicle also needed to be towed from the scene due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as this vehicle traveling over, passing through the intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event is a decision error, misjudgment of gap or other\'s speed.  He claimed to be in good health, but was taking a prescribed medication to lower blood pressure that was thought not to contribute to the crash.  Furthermore, his emotional and fatigue levels at the time of the crash, as well as the days preceding, were normal.

This one-vehicle crash occurred off of the roadway at a "T" intersection in an end departure configuration.  Both roadways of the intersection consisted of two, non-divided lanes of travel, each in opposite directions.  The northbound lane, upon which V1 (V1) was traveling, was controlled by a stop sign with no visual obstructions.  The posted speed limit for V1 was 40kph (25mph), while the crossing lane had a posted speed limit of 56kph (35mph).  There were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash, and the roadway was dry.  The gradient for the north/south lane was measured to be 6%; the crossroad was level.\n\nV1, a 1992 Oldsmobile 88 Royale, was traveling north approaching a stop sign at the intersection.  The vehicle crossed through the intersection, departed the roadway, and traveled down a fairly steep embankment of nearly 3 meters (10 feet).   V1 then traveled approximately 20-25 meters (66-82 feet) off of the roadway where it came to final rest, slightly hanging over another embankment leading down towards abandoned railroad tracks.  The vehicle had to be lifted back onto the roadway with the assistance of a bulldozer before being towed from the scene due to damage.   \n\nAll attempts to obtain the interview from the driver, a 24-year old male, were unsuccessful.  The PAR contained a narrative detailing the cause of this crash.  Initially the driver stated he lost control of the vehicle after swerving from the path of another vehicle.  When the officer followed up with the driver, the driver believed that he lost consciousness, which led him to drive off of the roadway and down the embankment.  The driver was trapped in the vehicle for approximately 90 minutes before being found.  He was transported to the hospital due to injuries.  According to the medical report, the driver suffered a broken right femur.  \n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event was end departure.  The Critical Reason for the Pre-crash Event was driver related - heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act. Few contributory factors could be determined - the driver did cite fatigue as a factor to police investigators.

This V2 crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane, not physically divided roadway.  There was an intersecting road, although the intersection did not play a part in this crash, and there were no traffic signals controlling the intersection. The posted speed limit upon which both vehicles were traveling was 40 kmph (25 mph).  There were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident, and the roadway was dry.  The gradient for this roadway was measured to be level.\n\nV1 (V1) was a large truck and was heading north on the roadway.  V2 (V2) was a light vehicle and was also heading in the same direction, traveling behind V1.  There was a green traffic light up a few blocks.  The driver of V2 noticed this and was wondering why traffic was not moving.  V2 decided to go around the truck using the shoulder to achieve this.  After overtaking the truck, V2 attempted to return back to the original lane of travel at which point V2 was struck by the large truck.   The front of the large truck made contact with the driver side of V2.  The impact caused the light vehicle to spin counter clockwise approximately 30 degrees before coming to final rest in the roadway.  \n\nThe driver of the large truck did not suffer any injuries as a result of the crash.  The truck itself had minimal damage and was driven from the scene.  Numerous attempts at obtaining the interview from the driver of V1 were unsuccessful.  The Critical Precrash Event for this vehicle was coded as other vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane (same direction - over right lane line).  No Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded for this vehicle.  \n\nThe driver of V2 was transported to the hospital due to possible injuries.  The vehicle suffered moderate to major damage and had to be removed from the scene.  The interview was obtained on a follow up telephone call to the driver.  Through the interview, it was revealed that they were indeed in a hurry because of an appointment with the local DMV.  The driver also stated that they were not familiar with the surrounding area, and in addition, they had never driven on this particular roadway before.  As previously stated, the driver of V2 thought the green light ahead of them was for the intersection they were approaching.  That was not the case, as the signal was designated for an intersection a few blocks up.  Since the traffic was not moving the driver of V2 took it upon themselves to move around the truck in front of their vehicle.  When they attempted to return to the original travel lane, that is when the large truck (V1) struck V2.  The driver stated that no fatigue related issues played a part in this crash, and that no drugs were taken on the day of, or in the days prior to this incident.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for this vehicle was coded as this vehicle traveling over the lane line on left side of the travel lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as illegal maneuver, in that they passed another vehicle using a non-passing lane.

This V2 crash occurred in the middle of a 4-way intersection, controlled by traffic signals in all directions.  The east/west roadway consisted of 4 lanes.  The north/south roadway had only 2 lanes.  The posted speed limit was 56kph  (35mph).  There were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident and the roadway was dry.  The gradient for both vehicles involved was determined to be level.\n\nV1 (V1) was traveling west attempting to make a left at the intersection.  V2 (V2) was heading east, intending to continue straight through the intersection.  Both vehicles had a green light at the intersection, however V1 did not have a green arrow, as none was available.  Therefore V1 was required to yield to oncoming traffic.  V1 was traveling at approximately 18-32kph  (11-20mph) when the front of the vehicle struck the left front of the opposing vehicle (V2).  V2 was traveling at the speed of 56kph  (35mph) and spun clockwise, and then continued forward while V1 hit V2 again in the left side before coming to final rest on the property of the north/east corner of the intersection.  The impact also caused V1 to spin counter-clockwise and continued forward.  V1 was driven to a safer place after impact off to the side of the road.  Only V2 had to be removed from the scene due to damage.\n\nThe driver of V1 did not suffer any injuries as a result of the impact.  The interview with driver of V1 on scene revealed that he did not see the oncoming vehicle as he was making the left turn.  He knew that he had a green light and thought the "coast was clear."  Since the driver did not see the other vehicle until the very last second, no avoidance actions were taken.  The driver did not make a note of any internal or external distractions.  Further, no inattentive factors for V1 were attributed to this crash.  The driver did mention that he had a minor heart condition, but that it did not hinder his ability to operate the vehicle.  He was not currently taking any medication, prescription or otherwise, at the time of the crash.  The fatigue level of the driver could have been described as normal.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for this vehicle was coded as turning left at intersection.   The reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see).\n\nV2 was traveling at approximately 56kph (35mph) through the intersection before it was struck by V1.  After realizing a crash was about to occur, the driver of V2 hit the brakes and steered to the right in an attempt to avoid the collision.  Unfortunately, this action was not sufficient enough to prevent this crash from taking place.  \n\nAll three occupants of V2 were transported to the hospital for possible injuries.  The interview was obtained from the front seat passenger, who claimed that the driver of V2 was in good physical health.  The driver also was not taking any type of medication on the day of, or days leading up to the crash.  V2 was making a trip of quite some distance, but the two front seat occupants would take turns driving.  They would switch about every five or six hours, with short breaks in between.  The interviewee claimed they were only driving no more than one half hour from the last break, before the impact occurred.  No emotional or fatigue related issues were mentioned as a factor of this crash.  In addition, no internal or external distractions could be attributed to this crash.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for this incident was coded as other motor vehicle encroachment from opposite direction-over left lane line.  No Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded to this vehicle.  \n\n

This accident occurred on a two-way, two-lane roadway. The roadway is not physically divided, and has a traffic-control device at the intersection.  The conditions were as follows: early evening, dark, clear skies, the roadway was wet and there was no atmospheric conditions.  The gradient for the three vehicles involved were all level.  The posted speed limit for V1 was 35 mph (56 kmph) and V2 was 40 mph (72 kmph). \n\nV1 was a 2003 Chevrolet Impala, traveling northbound, and had a red light at the intersection.  V1 reported to the Police and related to me to have driven through the red light, just prior to the crash.  V2 a 2000 Ford Focus was traveling westbound through a green light at the intersection.  \nV2 struck V1 on the right rear door and down the side toward the right front door.  V2 came to final rest in the middle of the intersection and in front of the opposing traffic.  The impact caused V1 to be pushed up and spun counter clockwise by almost 180 degrees, in the intersection.  When V1 spun around, it was reported that it struck V3.  V3 was stopped waiting to proceed straight, in the opposite direction of V1.  Shortly after the initial impact, V2 caught fire, probably starting at or near the battery, because of the angle of the crash for V2.  Just V1 and V2 were towed due to damage.  V3 was able to be driven from the scene.\n\nThe drivers of the three vehicles and the one passenger did not need treatment, because they did not suffer any injuries.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as: this vehicle crossing over or passing through the intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event is unknown, because the researcher was not able to obtain an interview.  The driver of V1 would not return the researchers phone calls.   \n\nV2 was a 2000 Ford Focus was traveling westbound and had a green light at the intersection.  Upon realization of the impending crash, the driver of V2 attempted to avoid the crash by braking and steering her vehicle at the last moment to the right.  With this maneuver, the driver unfortunately could not prevent this crash.  Shortly after the impact, this vehicle caught fire, which was believed to have started at the battery.  This vehicle also needed to be towed from the scene.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from crossing street across path.  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle.  The driver of V2, refused to give the researcher an interview.\n\nV3 was a 2003 Honda Accord was traveling southbound and had a red light at the intersection.  This vehicle was stopped at the intersection, awaiting the light to turn.  After V1 was hit it spun around and hit V3.  This vehicle did not need to be towed from the scene.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V3 was coded as not involved in first harmful event.  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle.

This V2 crash occurred on a two-lane, two-way, undivided roadway.  There were no vehicle traffic control signals present for this particular stretch of roadway.   The road had a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph).  It had just started to rain slightly but the road was still considered dry at the time of the incident.  The gradient for this trafficway was measured to be level.  \n\nV1 (V1) and V2 (V2) were both light vehicles.  V1, a 2002 Honda Civic, was approaching V2, a 1980 Dodge Aspen, at approximately 34-48 kmph (21-30 mph), heading in the same direction.  V2 was stopped on the roadway waiting to make a left turn into a private driveway.  The left front of V1 made contact with the rear right of V2.  The impact caused V2 to rotate counter-clockwise approximately 90 degrees before coming to final rest in the entranceway of a daycare center.  V1 continued forward before coming to final rest in its original lane of travel.  Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to damage.\n\nThe driver of V1, a 69-year old female, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the impact.  The interview with the driver of V1 did not yield much information.  She was not really sure what the reason for this crash was.  She claimed that there was another car directly in front of her vehicle and behind V2.  She stated that the car in front of hers went around V2, which was waiting to make a left hand turn into a daycare center.  As soon as she realized the impending danger she hit the brakes.  This action was unfortunately not enough to prevent the crash from occurring.  The driver of V1 claimed to be in good health; however, she was taking some prescription medication.  One prescription was a hormone-replacement medication and the other medication was a thyroid-replacement medication.  No deviance from the driver\'s normal sleep pattern was noted, and she claimed to be well rested at the time of the incident.  Further, no emotional stresses were believed to be a factor in this crash.  She was wearing her prescription lenses that corrected both hyperopic and myopic vision conditions. The Critical Precrash Event for this driver was when another motor vehicle was stopped in her lane.  The Critical Reason was coded as an "other" recognition error - driver focused on extraneous vehicle. The driver kept watching the vehicle she had been following as it swerved around V2. The weather was also coded as an associated factor - it was drizzling at the time of the crash.\n\nThe driver of V2, a 31-year old female, was not seriously hurt; however, she was taken to the hospital for evaluation.  V2 was stopped in the traffic lane waiting to make a left turn into a daycare center.  The interview could not be obtained from this person because no phone number was provided on the Police Accident Report.  There was a phone number on the medical report but no one could be reached at that number. The Critical Precrash Event for this driver was when another motor vehicle was in her lane traveling in the same direction with higher speed.  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle. One associated factor coded to this vehicle was the weather, because it was drizzling out at the time of the crash. No other information about the driver of V2 was known because there was no interview.\n

This V2 crash occurred on a two-way, three-lane, not physically divided roadway.  The posted speed limit was 72kph (45mph).  There were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident and the roadway was dry.  \n\nV1 (V1) was exiting a parking lot, which had a gradient of +2.  V2 (V2) was going straight on a level roadway, passing the parking lot from where V1 was exiting.  There were no traffic control devices present at the location of this crash.    \n\nV1 a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee was attempting to make a left onto the westbound roadway from a parking lot from a convenience store.  V2 a 1992 Chevy Cavalier was traveling east on the main roadway at approximately 64kph (40mph).  The front left of V2 made contact with the left rear of V1.  The impact caused V1 to spin counter clockwise before coming to final rest in the westbound lane.  V2 continued further ahead before coming to rest in between lanes one and two of the roadway.   V2 was removed from the scene due to moderate damage, whereas V1 suffered minor damage and was removed by the owner.  \n\nNumerous attempts and messages could not generate an interview with the driver of V1 who had already departed the scene upon my arrival.  However, through information collected by the police officer, it appears that the driver failed to look both ways before entering the roadway.  Based on this information, the Critical Precrash Event was coded this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection (from parking lot).  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as recognition error, inadequate surveillance, in that the driver failed to look both ways.  As far as the details of fatigue, medication, or possible distractions are concerned, this information remains unknown.  The driver of V1 did not suffer any injuries as a result of this crash.\n\nThe passenger of V2 was taken to the hospital for possible injuries, and the driver accompanied them before my arrival.  An attempt was made to contact the driver of V2 using the number provided on the Police Accident Report.  Unfortunately the person who answered claimed that it was not the residence of the driver in question.  A match could not be found using sources such as the phone book or the Internet.  Because no interview could be obtained, any other factors that may have contributed to this crash are unknown at this time.  The Critical Precrash Event coded to this vehicle was other vehicle encroachment (from driveway, turning in opposite direction).  There was no Critical Reason coded to this vehicle.  \n\n  \n

This crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane, not physically divided roadway.  The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph) and there were no traffic signals associated with this stretch of roadway.  The roadway was dry and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident.  The roadway is considered to be level where the crash occurred.  \n\nV1 (V1) was a white minivan traveling west and intending to continue straight on the roadway.  V2 (V2) was a red pick-up truck, legally parked on the eastbound shoulder of the roadway.  There was an occupant in the driver\'s side of the vehicle, however V2 should be considered not in transport.  V1 crossed the double yellow lines and struck a wall first before continuing forward, and making contact with the parked pick-up.  The impact between vehicles caused V2 to be pushed up over the curb before coming to final rest.  V1 had considerable damage to the front and driver side of the vehicle and had to be removed from the scene.  V2 had minor damage and did not have to be removed from the scene.  \n\nThe driver of V1 was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure, although injuries were thought to be minor.  The follow up interview with the driver revealed that he might have been talking on the CB radio right before the crash occurred, but he wasn\'t entirely certain.  He stated that he was traveling approximately 50-64 kmph (31-40 mph) when all of a sudden, he veered left and side swiped a brick wall.  He then applied the foot brakes but could not bring the vehicle to a stop before contacting the pick-up truck that was parked on the shoulder.  No fatigue or health related issues were thought to have contributed to this crash.  The driver did say that he had diabetes and was taking medication to help control that condition.  In addition, he was taking a cholesterol-lowering medication as well.  The Critical Precrash Event was coded as: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the left side of travel lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as an internal distraction.  \n\nAs previously stated, V2 was traveling east on the roadway before pulling off to the shoulder where he used his cell phone.  While parked on the shoulder, he observed V1 cross the double yellow lane line and make impact with a stone wall.  After the initial impact, V1 continue forward before making contact with V2.  The occupant complained of neck pain and was taken to the hospital for evaluation.  A brief interview was conducted with the occupant of V2.  He claimed that he thought the driver of V1 had passed out and that is what caused him to cross into the opposite lane.  The was no Critical Precrash Event or Critical Reason coded to this vehicle because he was not involved in the first harmful event.

This late-night, V2 crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane, not physically divided roadway.  The posted speed limit was 56kph (35mph) and there were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident.  The gradient for both vehicles involved was level.  No traffic control devices were associated with this crash.  \n\nV1 (V1) was traveling eastbound and had just negotiated a right curve.  For unknown reasons, V1 partially left the right side of the roadway and overcompensated the vehicle when trying to return.  This caused V1 to spin laterally in a counterclockwise direction.  After loosing control of the vehicle, the passenger side of V1 made contact with the front of V2 (V2), which was traveling in the opposite direction.  The impact caused V1 to spin in a clockwise direction, approximately 180 degrees, before coming to final rest entirely off of the roadway on the property of a nearby house.  After colliding with V1, V2 spun clockwise, also approximately 180 degrees, before coming to rest partially off of the roadway on the same property as V1.  The travel speeds of both vehicles could not be determined.  \n\nAll three occupants involved were airlifted to nearby hospitals due to injuries.  Unfortunately, the interviews of the drivers could not be obtained.  Therefore, some pertinent information could not be acquired, thus giving an incomplete synopsis of events.  There was however, some witness information given to the officers that help complete the scenario.  \n\nAccording to a witness that was traveling ahead of and in the same direction as V1, V1 had been tailgating the witness before the crash took place.   V1 then attempted to pass the witness in a no-passing zone on the left side of the witness\'s vehicle, preceding the right curve in the roadway.  After passing the witness, V1 tried to get back into the eastbound lane, but apparently had taken the turn too hard and at a rate of speed that was considered unsafe.  Subsequently, V1 slightly left the right side of the roadway and overcompensated his vehicle to the left, causing him to spin laterally in a counterclockwise motion.  With no control of the vehicle, V1 could not avoid colliding with V2, which was traveling in the westbound lane, approaching the left curve.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded decision error, too fast for curve.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as: other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction, over left lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to this vehicle.

This three-vehicle crash occurred in a 4-way intersection controlled by traffic signals in all directions. Both roadways were undivided with two lanes and a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph).  It was slightly overcast at the time of the incident, and the roadway was wet from a previous rainfall.  The gradient at this particular location was determined to be level.  \n\nV1 (V1), a gold 2000 Nissan Altima, was traveling east at approximately 35 mph (56 kmph) intending to continue through the intersection.  V2 (V2), a white 2001 Sterling street sweeper, was traveling north at approximately 10 mph (16 kph) also intending to continue straight through the intersection.  V3 (V3) was a red 2001 Dodge Durango legally parked on the side of the eastbound roadway.  As V1 passed through the intersection, the front side of the vehicle made contact with the left rear of the street sweeper.  After the initial impact, V1 continued forward and made contact with the back of V3 before coming to final rest.  The only vehicle that had to be towed from the scene as a result of damage was V1.  \n\nThe driver of V1, a 26-year old female, was taken to the hospital for possible injuries.  After numerous attempts, the interview with the driver could not be obtained. As described on the Police Accident Report (PAR), V1 attempted to avoid the collision by slamming the brakes.  This unfortunately was not enough to prevent the crash.  It was also revealed on the PAR that there were witnesses present at the time of the incident.  They claimed that the light had turned green for north/south traffic.  With this information, the Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as crossing over (passing through) intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as an illegal maneuver, because V1 apparently went through a red light.  Associated factors coded to this driver include speeding and aggressive driving. \n\nSome unfortunate information about the driver of V2, a 56-year old male, was disclosed to the researcher of this case.  He unexpectedly passed away approximately one month after the incident.  He was not taken to the hospital after the crash, so no medical reports were available.  No official reason was given as to the cause of death.  It is the opinion of the researcher that his death was in no way related to the crash.  The Critical Pre-crash Event coded to V2 was other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across path.  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle.  No associated factors could be coded to the driver of V2 due to the lack of an interview.\n\nSince V3 was legally parked on the side of the road, no pre-crash information was required.  There was only minor damage to the rear bumper of the vehicle.\n

This V2 crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection, controlled by light signals in all directions.  The two-way roadway was not physically divided.  The east/west roadway consisted of four lanes, while the north/south roadway, only had two lanes.  The posted speed limit for the road upon which both vehicles were traveling was 56 kph (35 mph).  There was consistent rainfall at the time of the incident, thus making the roadway wet.  There was an uphill grade for both vehicles, as the intersection formed the peak of the two hills.  \n\nV1 (V1), a 2002 Honda Civic, was traveling westbound intending to pass through the intersection.  V2 (V2), a 1994 Jeep Cherokee was traveling eastbound, intending to make a left at the intersection.  As V1 was crossing over the intersection, V2 turned in front of V1.  The front of V1 made contact with the right front of V2.  Both vehicles were removed from the scene due to damage.  \n\nThe driver of V1 suffered minor injuries, but did not require transportation to a hospital.  The driver was still on scene upon my arrival, but did not feel comfortable participating in the interview.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for this vehicle was coded as other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction - over left lane line.  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle.\n\nThe driver of V2 did not suffer any injuries as a result of the crash.  The driver had already left the scene when I arrived.  Numerous phone calls were made to the driver, however, an interview could not be obtained.  Through information contained in the Police Accident Report, the view of V2 may have been hindered by another vehicle.  As traffic was backing up in the westbound lane, a vehicle in lane two westbound was going to allow V2 to make the left turn.  The driver of V2 did not see V1 coming into his lane while trying to cross the intersection.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as this vehicle traveling turning left at intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded to this vehicle as view obstructed by other vehicle.  It should also be noted that the view could have been further obstructed by the fact that the intersection was at the top of a slight hill.   \n

This V4 chain reaction crash occurred on a two-way, three-lane roadway.  The middle lane acts as a common turning lane for both directions.  The posted speed limit on the roadway was 64kph (40mph).  There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident, although it was slightly cloudy.  The gradient for all vehicles involved was determined to be level. \n\nV1 (V1), a 2000 Mercury Grand Marquis, was traveling in the south bound lane, at approximately 48kph (30mph), intending to continue straight on the roadway.  V2 (V2) was a 1990 Honda Civic, which was stopped in the roadway for a traffic light at the intersection ahead.  V3 (V3) was a 2003 Acura TL, which was also stopped in the roadway in front of V2.  V4 (V4), a 2000 Chevy Cavalier was stopped in front of V3 on the roadway.  The front of V1 made contact with the back of V2 which then in turn, contacted the back of V3 which ultimately contacted the back of V4.  V1 continued forward a bit before coming to final rest.  All the other vehicles also continued forward as a result of the crash before coming to final rest.  \n\nThe driver of V1 did not suffer any injuries from the crash.  Although he was on scene, he did not want to answer any questions at that time.  He said I could call later, however he never returned any of my calls.  For this reason, an interview could not be obtained.  Through information contained in the Police Accident Report (PAR), as well as conversation I overheard while on scene, the driver of V1 apparently looked away from the roadway at a piece of paper he had in the vehicle.  By the time he focused his attention back on the roadway, he realized the crash was imminent.  He applied the brakes, unfortunately this was not enough to prevent the crash from occurring.   The vehicle was towed from the scene as a result of damage.  The Critical Precrash Event for this vehicle was coded as other motor vehicle stopped in lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as internal distraction.  \n\nThe driver of V2 had minor injuries, but did not require transportation to a hospital.  Through the interview obtained from this driver, no other additional factors seemed to have played a role in this crash.  Both fatigue and emotional levels appeared to be normal.  He was not taking any medication, prescription or otherwise, on the day of or in the days preceding the incident.  The driver stated that he was talking to a passenger, however this was not considered a cause, as the driver was already stopped in the roadway.  It is the opinion of the researcher, that there was nothing this driver could have done to prevent the crash.  The vehicle itself was towed from the scene as a result of damage. The Critical Precrash Event coded to this vehicle was other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in same lane while deceleration.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to this vehicle.\n\nThe driver of V3 did not suffer any injuries as a result of the crash.  Seeing as this vehicle did not have to be towed from the scene, the driver of V3 left shortly after my arrival.  Numerous attempts to contact the driver were unsuccessful.   This vehicle, which was also stopped, had no chance of avoiding the collision.  The Critical Precrash Event coded not involved in first harmful event.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to this vehicle.  \n\nThe driver of V4 also came away unscathed from the crash.   A vehicle inspection as well as an interview was not required for this vehicle.  Even so, no critical conditions were attributed to this vehicle.  There was nothing that could have been done to prevent this vehicle from being hit.  \n

This V2 crash occurred in the middle of a two-way, five-lane roadway.  Traffic signals controlled all directions of the intersection.  The roadway was not physically divided for V1 (V1); however, there was a divider for V2 (V2).  V1 had a slight downhill grade, but the gradient for V2 was level. The roadway was dry, and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident. The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph).\n\nV1, a 2000 Ford Windstar, was traveling north at approximately 24 kmph (15 mph). V1 then attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, but contacted the left front corner of V2.  V2 was traveling south, at approximately 56 kmph (35 mph) intending to continue straight through the intersection.  At impact, V1 spun counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees before coming to rest in the southbound travel lane.  V2 continued forward before coming to final rest, also in the southbound travel lane.  Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to damage. \n\nThe driver of V1, a 50-year old female, did not suffer any injuries, nor did the passenger in the vehicle.  Neither of the individuals from V1 was present at the scene upon researcher arrival.  An interview with the driver could not be obtained, even after numerous attempts to contact her.  The Police Accident Report (PAR) indicated that the driver of V1 was in the left turn lane, although she claimed that her intention was to continue straight through the intersection under the overpass.  When traffic prevented her from accomplishing this, she decided to make the left turn.  It is unclear whether fatigue, medications, or distractions played any role in this crash due to the lack of an interview.  The Critical Pre-crash Event for this vehicle was coded as turning left at intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as an unknown recognition error. \n\nThe driver of V2, a 26-year old female, was on-scene upon researcher arrival.  She suffered from a bruise on her head and received an ice pack from EMS to reduce the swelling.  The researcher attempted to conduct an interview while on-scene, however she was not "in the mood" to answer any questions.  She was obviously still a bit shaken up.  The researcher tried to reach her by phone, but could not get in touch with her.  The Critical Pre-crash Event for this vehicle was coded as other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction - over the left lane line. The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle. No associated factors could be coded to this driver due to a lack of an interview.\n\n

This V2 crash occurred in the middle of a 4-way intersection controlled by traffic signals in all directions.  Both roadways were two-way, two-lane roadways that were not physically divided. The crash occurred in the mid-evening hours. Streetlamps were present and illuminated at the time of the incident.  The roadway upon which V1 (V1) was traveling had a slightly positive grade, while the roadway upon which V2 (V2) was traveling was considered to be level.  The posted speed limit for V1 was 80 kmph (50 mph) and the posted speed limit for V2 was 72 kmph (45 mph).   \n\nV1, a 2004 Toyota Highlander, was traveling west approaching the intersection.  V2, a 1997 Acura CL, was stopped at a red light in the southbound lane waiting to pass through the intersection.  When V2\'s light turned green, it entered the intersection, at which time the front of V1 contacted the left side of V2.  The impact sent V2 up a nearby driveway before coming to final rest.  V1 spun counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees after the first impact and then made contact with a stone wall at the entrance of the driveway.  After hitting the wall, V1 then proceeded to roll backward, coming to final rest in the middle of the intersection.  \n\nThe driver of V1, a 39-year old female, was not injured and did not require EMS transport to a hospital.  There were two other occupants in V1 in addition to the driver.  One of the other occupants received minor injuries and was transported to the hospital to be observed.  After numerous attempts, the interview could not be obtained from the driver of V1.  The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as this vehicle crossing over (passing through) intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as an illegal maneuver. One associated factor coded to this driver was a sightline restriction due to shrubbery on the side of the road. This probably blocked V1\'s view of V2 until V2 entered the intersection.\n\nThe driver of V2, a 47-year old male, received major injuries as a result of the crash, including but not limited to a collapsed lung, and was transported to the hospital.  An interview was obtained from the driver of V2.  He stated that he was stopped at a red light and when the light turned green, he proceeded to travel into the intersection.  At that moment he noticed something in his peripheral vision.  There was nothing he could do to avoid the accident. A witness who was stopped facing eastbound for the red light corroborated the driver of V2\'s version of events. The Critical Pre-crash Event for the driver of V2 was when another vehicle encroached into his lane from a crossing street, across his path. The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle. One associated factor coded to this driver was a sightline restriction due to shrubbery on the side of the road. This probably blocked V2\'s view of V1 until V2 entered the intersection.\n

This three-vehicle accident occurred on a two-way, two-lane roadway, which was not physically divided.  There were no permanent traffic signals present at the scene of the incident, however, there were warnings signs as well as a flagman, indicating a construction zone in the area.  The grades for both V1 (V1) and V3 (V3) were level, whereas the gradient for V2 (V2) was slightly negative.  There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.  The posted speed limit for the roadway was 72 kmph (45 mph). \n\nV1, a 2000 Ford F-150, was traveling north at an undetermined rate of speed.  V2, a 2003 Kenworth dump truck, was traveling south on the same roadway in the opposite direction, at an unknown rate of speed.  V3, a 2002 Pontiac Grand Am, was stopped in the northbound lane ahead of V1, due to construction.  For reasons that are unclear, V1 crossed over the center double yellow lines, and the front of the vehicle contacted the front of V2.  After the initial impact, V1 continued forward and the left front of the vehicle made contact with the right rear of V3, where both vehicles came to final rest.  The front axle of the heavy truck (V2) separated from the vehicle causing it to continue approximately 150 feet before coming to final rest.   \n\nThe driver of V1, a 24 year-old male, had a laceration to his arm and was taken to the hospital for observation.  The driver could not be reached for an interview, so it is unclear whether or not any fatigue or health related issues contributed to this crash.  The Police Accident Report (PAR) mentioned that the driver claimed that he swerved into oncoming traffic because he thought a car was pulling out from a parking lot into his lane of travel.  Further, he did not realize that the traffic ahead was stopped due to ongoing construction.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to this vehicle was that this vehicle traveled over the lane line on the left side of travel lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event  was coded as too fast for conditions (i.e. construction).\n\nThe driver of V2, a 44 year-old male, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the crash, and therefore did not require any medical attention.  Numerous messages during various times of the day could not provide the researcher with an interview.  Through information contained in the PAR and evidence at the scene, it seems there was nothing the driver could have done to avoid the collision.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event was coded to this vehicle was other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction, over left lane line.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event  was not coded to this vehicle.\n\nThe driver of V3 was a 35 year-old male who complained of neck and back pain and was air lifted to a hospital for treatment.  Information received via an interview did not reveal many Precrash facts, being as the driver was the victim of circumstances, which occurred as a result of the second event of the crash.  There were no health or fatigue related issues that contributed to this crash for the driver of V3.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event was coded not involved in first harmful event.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event  was not coded to this vehicle.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n

This crash occurred at a T-intersection of two undivided roadways. The east/west roadway had four lanes of travel (two in each direction) and the north/south roadway had two lanes of travel (one in each direction). The southbound roadway ended at the T-intersection and was controlled by a stop sign. The east/west roadway had no traffic control device. The conditions were as follows: early evening, partly cloudy skies, the roadway was dry and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions.  The gradient for southbound traffic was +4 percent. The westbound roadway at the intersection was level. The posted speed limit on the north/south roadway was 40 kmph (25 mph).  The posted speed limit on the east/west roadway was 72 kmph (45 mph).\n\nV1, a 2005 Chevrolet Malibu, was driven by a 38-year old male. V1 was initially traveling southbound, and was intending to turn left at the T-intersection to head eastbound.  V2, a 2004 Chrysler Pacifica, was driven by a 39-year old female who was traveling westbound. Traffic was backed-up in the first westbound lane and had come to a stop. Traffic in the second westbound lane was still moving. V2 was traveling in lane two. A non-contact box truck that was stopped in the first westbound lane waved out V1 from its stop sign. As V1 pulled across the second westbound lane, the left front of V1 struck the left front of V2.  \n\nThere was no driver interview obtained for V1 after numerous times of trying to contact the driver.  V1 needed to be towed due to damage.  The police report did not indicate any injuries or the involvement of drugs or alcohol.   The police reported V1 traveling at an unknown speed.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as this vehicle turning left at intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as an "other" decision error - turned with obstructed view. The non-contact vehicle was coded as a sightline restriction. Other associated factors coded to this driver include inadequate surveillance and a traffic flow interruption caused by rush hour congestion.\n\nThere was no driver interview obtained for V2 after numerous times of trying to contact the driver.  V2 needed to be towed due to damage.  The police report did not indicate any injuries or the involvement of drugs or alcohol.   The police reported V2 traveling at an unknown speed.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, turning into opposite direction.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was not coded to this vehicle. Associated factors coded to this driver include an "other" recognition error in that the impending problem was masked by the traffic flow pattern, a sightline restriction caused by the non-contact truck in the right lane, and the traffic flow interruption caused by rush hour congestion.\n

\nThis V2 crash occurred in the middle of a \xe2\x80\x9cT\xe2\x80\x9d intersection.  The northbound lane was a one-way roadway, which intersected the two-way, two-lane east/west roadway.  A stop sign was present for the one-way traffic, however there were no signs or signals present for the east/west roadway.  The incident occurred in the early morning hours, and it was raining at the time of the crash.  Both roadways were considered to be level, and both roadways had a posted speed limit of 40kph (25mph).  \n\nV1 (V1), a 2003 Suzuki XL-7, was traveling north on the one-way roadway approaching the intersection.  V2 (V2), a 1989 Nissan Maxima, was traveling west on the two-way roadway also approaching the intersection.  The front of V2 made contact with the left front of V1.  Both vehicles came to final rest shortly after the impact.  V1 was driven from the scene, however, V2 had to be towed due to vehicle damage.  \n\nThe driver of V1, a 40-year old male, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the crash and did not require any medical attention.   An interview could not be obtained from the driver because the telephone number on the Police Accident Report (PAR) was for a fax machine.  No record of the driver could be found in the phone book or on the Internet.  Through information contained in the PAR, it was revealed that the driver of V1 was not familiar with the area.  Further, he believed that the crossing roadway was also a one-way roadway and that V2 had a stop sign as well.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event was coded as unknown travel direction because the driver\'s intentions were unclear.  The Critcal Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as false assumption of other\'s actions, because he thought V2 had to stop at the intersection.  \n\nThe driver of V2, a 46 year-old female, did receive injuries, however, the severity of which are unknown.  The driver was taken to the hospital for treatment.  After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained from the driver.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, intended path not known.  The Critical Reason for the  Critical Precrash Event was not coded to this vehicle.  \n

This V2 crash occurred on a two-lane undivided level roadway.  The posted speed limit on the roadway was 48 kmph (30 mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident, although it was slightly cloudy.    \n\nV1 (V1), a 1995 Chevrolet Camaro, was driven by a 20-year old male. V2 (V2), a 2002 Ford Windstar, was driven by a 26-year old female. V1 and V2 were both traveling south on the same roadway, with V1 coming up behind V2 at approximately 80 kmph (50 mph).  The driver of V2 had decelerated and then stopped in her lane while waiting for an oncoming vehicle to pass so that she could turn left into a driveway.  For unknown reasons, V1 attempted to pass V2 on the left, ignoring the double yellow line.  As V1 was passing V2, V2 started to make a left into the driveway.  The right side of V1 contacted the left front of V2.  V1 then continued forward and made contact with the northbound curb before crossing the southbound lane again, and running into an embankment.  Finally, before coming to final rest, the front of V1 made contact with a mailbox on the property of the southbound side of the roadway.   After the initial impact, V2 continued forward approximately 20 feet before coming to final rest.  \n\nThe driver of V1 was taken to the hospital for possible injuries.  A phone interview could not be obtained from the driver of V1.  According to the police officer, the driver did not have a license to operate a motor vehicle and spoke very little English.  V1 had to be towed from the scene as a result of damage to the undercarriage.  Through information obtained from the police accident report, the Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as this vehicle traveling over the left side of travel lane.  The reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as an illegal maneuver, in that the driver ignored the double yellow lines.  Associated factors coded to this driver include excess speed, aggressive driving, and a false assumption of other road user\'s actions in that the driver of V1 assumed that V2 would stay in her lane.\n\nThe driver of V2 was also taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure.  Numerous attempts at obtaining the interview were unsuccessful.  According to information relayed to the researcher by the police officer, the driver of V2 was waiting for an oncoming vehicle to pass before making a left into a driveway.  As the driver was making the left, V1 attempted to pass V2 illegally.  The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded as this vehicle turning left at intersection.  The reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was not coded to this vehicle.  No associated factors could be coded due to the lack of an interview.\n\n

This V2 crash occurred on a one-way, two-lane roadway.  The crash ultimately ended at an intersection, however, the first harmful event occurred before the intersection.  There were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident and the roadway was found to be dry, straight, and level.  There were no traffic signals present where the crash took place and the posted speed limit for both vehicles involved was 40kmph (25mph).\n\nV1, a 1995 Chevrolet Blazer, was traveling north at an unknown rate of speed in lane one of the one-way roadway.  V2, a 1992 Nissan Sentra, was also traveling north in lane two at an unknown rate of speed.  V1 attempted to change from lane one to lane two.  The left side of V1 contacted the right side of V2.  After the initial impact, V2 continued forward, through an intersection and made contact with a utility pole on the left side of the roadway.  V1 came to final rest approximately 10 meters ahead of V2.  V1 did not sustain enough damage to warrant a tow, however, V2 sustained major damage from contact with the pole and had to be towed from the scene.  \n\nThe driver of V1, a 22 year-old male, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the collision and did not require any medical attention.  Because V1 did not sustain disabling damage, the vehicle was driven from the scene shortly after the researcher\'s arrival.  There was no telephone number provided on the Police Accident Report, and no number could be acquired through investigation.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to this vehicle was this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the left side of travel lane.  It is the researcher\'s opinion that V2 could not be seen by V1 when he attempted to switch lanes.  Because of this, the reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as inadequate surveillance.  No other factors could be attributed as a cause of this crash for V1.  \n\nThe driver of V2, a male whose age was unknown, suffered moderate to major injuries and was flown to a nearby hospital for treatment.  As was the case with the driver of V1, there was no telephone number provided for the driver of V2.  No numbers could be acquired for the driver and therefore, no interview could be obtained.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to this vehicle was other vehicle encroachment, from adjacent lane over right lane line.  The reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to this vehicle.  There are no known associated factors coded to this vehicle and V2 was thought not to have contributed to the crash.\n

This single vehicle crash occurred at a T-intersection of two two-lane undivided roadways. The crash occurred in the late afternoon hours while still daylight. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and both roadways were dry, straight, and level. Both roadways had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). The intersection was controlled by stop signs for all directions. \n\nV1 (V1) was a 1997 Ford Explorer driven by a 17-year old male. V1 was traveling south on the roadway that ended at the T-intersection. V1 proceeded into the intersection without stopping at the stop sign and skidded across the east/west roadway, departing the roadway on the south edge of the road. The front left of V1 impacted a utility pole on the roadside. The front of V1 sustained moderate damage and had to be towed from the scene. \n\nThe driver of V1 complained of pain but refused medical treatment. There were two other teen-aged occupants in the vehicle at the time of the crash, and each of them complained of pain, but both also refused medical treatment. The driver did not want to provide an interview and told police that his wheels locked up and he lost control of his vehicle. Based on scene evidence and information from police, the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as this vehicle traveling through end departure. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as too fast for conditions. It was believed that the driver was traveling at an excessive rate of speed as he neared the intersection, began braking too late, and skidded into and through the intersection and off the south edge of the intersecting roadway. Associated factors coded to the driver include an illegal maneuver, aggressive driving, and inexperience.\n

\nThis V2 crash occurred in the middle of a 4-way intersection controlled by traffic signals in all directions.  The southbound roadway upon which V1 (V1) was traveling, consisted of three lanes.  The northbound roadway, upon which V2 (V2) was traveling, consisted of four lanes.  The crash occurred during daylight hours, and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.  The northbound roadway had a slight right curve as well as an incline.  The southbound lanes were straight and level.  The posted speed limit for both vehicles was 40kph (25mph).\n\nV1, a 1998 Jeep Cherokee, was traveling in lane two heading south, intending to make a left at the intersection.  V2, a 1996 Plymouth Voyager, was heading north in lane two intending to continue through the intersection.  Both vehicles did have a green light, however, V2 had a steady green, and therefore the right of way. As both vehicles entered the intersection the front of V2 struck the left front of V1.  The impact caused V2 to spin clockwise almost 360 degrees before coming to final rest againt the guardrail.  V1 spun counter clockwise almost 90 degrees before coming to rest in the eastbound roadway.  \n\nThe driver of V1, a 37 year-old male, was not injured and did not require any medical attention.  No other occupants were present in V1 at the time of the crash.  A complete interview was obtained from the driver of V1.  No fatigue or medical related factors were thought to play a role in this crash.  According to the driver, whose license was suspended, he did not see the approaching vehicle.  \n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event coded to V1 was: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as inadequate surveillance.  One associated factor coded to this driver was a sightline restriction due to an uphill grade for opposing traffic.  \n\nThe driver of V2, a 51 year-old male, received non-incapacitating injuries as a result of the crash, and was transported to a hospital for treatment.  The right front passenger of V2, a 47 year-old female, sustained severe injuries and was transported via helicopter to an emergency facility for treatment.  No interview could be obtained for V2, therefore it is uncertain if any fatigue or medical related issues had a role in this crash.  \n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event was coded other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction - over left lane line.  The reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was not coded to this vehicle.  \n

This one-vehicle crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane, not physically divided roadway.  The crash took place during daylight hours and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident.  The roadway upon which V1 was traveling was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph).  \n\nV1, a 1995 Dodge Dakota, was traveling east in lane one of the roadway.  The vehicle left its original lane of travel to the left into the opposing traffic lane.  V1 then continued off to the left leaving the roadway striking a tree stump, and continued down an embankment before coming to final rest in a drainage basin.  The vehicle sustained severe undercarriage damage. \n\nV1 was driven by a 46 year-old male in good health who was headed to his friend\'s home.  According to the driver, he was looking at a map, which was being held by the passenger.  The next thing he knew, he was headed off of the roadway and up the embankment.  However, the driver was suspected of consuming alcohol and was given a field sobriety test as well as a Breathalyzer test.  The police determined that he was not over the legal limit and was able to operate a motor vehicle.  The driver did not suffer from any injuries as a result of the crash and did not require any medical attention.  The passenger of V1, a 34 year-old female sustained minor injuries but did not require transport to a medical facility.  V1 was towed from the scene.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event that was coded as this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as an internal distraction; he was trying to read a map instead paying attention to the roadway, which caused his vehicle to drift off of the road.  The associated factors include a slight physical impairment due to alcohol and the driver\'s unfamiliarity with the road as he rarely drove it. \n

This V2 crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection that was controlled by traffic signals in all directions.  The two-way roadway, upon which V1 and V2 were traveling, consisted of four lanes.  The crash occurred during daylight hours, and there were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.  The roadway was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph).\n\nV1, a 1991 Mazda MX-6, was traveling west in lane two, which was designated for traffic proceeding straight through the intersection.  V2, a 2003 Honda Accord, was facing east and was stopped in lane three, the designated left-turn lane.  As V1 proceeded through the intersection it drifted over the left lane line and the front of V1 contacted the front of V2.  The impact caused V2 to be pushed back slightly before coming to final rest, while V1 continued forward before coming to final rest. \n\nThe driver of V1, a 36 year-old female, adamantly refused an interview and would not take part in the study.  The driver did complain of some pain as a result of the crash, however she did not require transport to a medical facility. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded as this vehicle traveling, over the lane line left side of travel lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as an unknown decision error.  There are no known associated factors coded to this vehicle.  \n\nV2 was driven by a 72 year-old male, in good health and wearing prescription lenses that corrected a Myopic (near-sighted) condition.  He stated that he was stopped at the traffic light when V1 crashed into him.  Neither the driver nor the passenger of V2 suffered any injuries and V2 driven from the scene.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to this vehicle was other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction - over left lane line.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to this vehicle.  An associated factor was the driver stated to have been talking to his passenger, however this was not thought to have contributed to this crash.

\n\nThis three-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection, which was controlled by traffic signals in all directions.  The east/west roadway consisted of 5 lanes at the intersection, whereas the north/south roadway consisted of six lanes at the southern end and five lanes at the northern end.  The grade for all vehicles involved was level except for V1 which was slightly downhill.  The posted speed limit for the east/west roadway was 64kph (40mph) and the posted speed limit for the north/south roadway was 72kph (45mph).  The incident occurred during daylight hours during a moderate rainfall.  \n\nV1 (V1), a 2004 black Chevrolet Malibu, was traveling east at approximately 16kph (10mph) intending to make a left at an intersection.  V2 (V2), a 1998 black Acura 3.5RL, was traveling west at approximately 64kph (40mph), intending to continue through the intersection.  V3 (V3), a 2005 red Honda Civic, was stopped at a traffic light in the southbound lanes.  As V1 attempted to make the left at the intersection, the front of V2 struck the right front of V1.  The impact caused V1 to spin counter-clockwise in a backwards motion approximately 270 degrees.  V2 continued forward and to the right, and ultimately struck the left front of V3 before coming to final rest.  V3 was pushed slightly to the right before coming to final rest.  All three vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage.\n\nThe driver of V1 was taken to the hospital for injuries including, but not limited to closed head injuries, and abrasions.  A complete interview was obtained from the driver.  The driver claimed that he was stopped in the middle of the intersection waiting to make a left turn.  At first he did not see the approaching vehicle (V2) because of a hill.  When the vehicle came into view, the driver stated that V2 was at least 150 yards away.  This occurred when the light, a steady green at the time, changed to yellow.  The driver of V1 then stated that he thought the light would change to red, and that the other vehicle would stop.  He offered that after the light turned to yellow, V2 must have slammed on the accelerator, because there was nothing he could do to avoid the collision.  The driver of V1 told the researcher that he was on prescription medication at the time of the incident.  The medication prescribed to the driver was to help an irregular heartbeat as well as high cholesterol among other ailments.  No fatigue related factors were thought to have played a role in this crash.  The Critical Precrash Event coded to V1 was: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as: misjudgment of gap or other\'s speed.\n\nThe driver of V2 had unknown injuries, but did not require transport to a medical facility.  A partial interview was obtained from the father of the driver for legal reasons.  According to the surrogate, V2 was intending to continue through the intersection.  V1 had all of the sudden made a left directly in from of V2, and there was nothing that could have been done to avoid the collision.  No fatigue or medical related factors were thought to have contributed to this crash.  The fact that the driver was inexperienced may have played a role.  The Critical Precrash Event coded to V2 was: other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction, over left lane line. The reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to this vehicle.  \n\nThe driver of V3 did not suffer any injuries as a result of the crash.  An interview could not be obtained from this driver, however the role of this driver was that of an innocent bystander.  No Critical Precrash Event, nor a reason for such, was coded to this vehicle since it was not involved in the first harmful event.  \n\nNOTE:\nIt should be noted that although the driver of V1 claimed a roadway grade that prevented him from seeing the other vehicle in time, it is the opinion of the researcher that there was not a significant grade for V2, which would have caused this.\n

This crash occurred as V1, 1995 Pontiac Transport, was turning right from a curved road to a driveway at a \xe2\x80\x9cT\xe2\x80\x9d intersection.  The crash occurred during daylight hours, and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions when the crash took place.  The east/west lanes of the roadway consisted of four lanes, two in each direction.  The north/south driveway that V1 was turning in to consisted of three lanes.  Two of the lanes were designated for the northbound traffic, and one was for southbound traffic.  There was an island dividing the two directions of travel.  The posted speed limit for the east/west lanes was 64kph (40mph).\n\nV1 was heading east in the first lane of travel.  As the vehicle turned into the driveway, it failed to slow down and veered off of the roadway striking the center median.  V1 was than redirected across the roadway over the curb on the right side and through a fence.  After contacting the fence, which crossed a bridge, the vehicle proceeded to fall approximately 10-15 feet before coming to final rest in a shallow stream.  Both airbags were deployed as a result of the collision. The vehicle had to be towed from the scene due to frontal damage, as well as damage to the undercarriage.  \n\nThe driver of V1 was airlifted to a nearby hospital for evaluation.  According to the police, the driver spoke very poor English and did not recollect exactly what happened.  Attempts at contacting the driver were not successful.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side.  The Critical Reason was coded as a driver related factor, a decision error, traveling too fast for curve/turn.  It is believed that the driver was attempting to make the turn while driving too fast, and lost control the vehicle. It is unknown if any associated factors were involved in this crash as the driver could not be interviewed.\n\n\n

This crash occurred on a parking lot drive-through roadway. The roadway was an unmarked undivided 2-lane roadway with designated parking spaces on either side of the roadway. At the time of the crash, it was early afternoon and the roadway was dry. At the point of the first impact, the roadway was level. There was no posted speed limit sign.\n\nV1 was a 2005 Chevrolet Malibu that was traveling westbound on the roadway. V2, a 2002 Nissan Pathfinder, pulled out of a parking space to the left of V1, attempting to turn left to travel in the same direction as V1. The front left of V1 struck the right side front of V2. This impact rotated V2 in a counterclockwise direction, causing the left front of V2 to strike a parked vehicle to its left, a 2004 Ford Focus. After striking V2, V1 struck two other parked vehicles on the right and then continued westbound on the roadway. V1 then departed the roadway to the right and struck some bushes and trees. The police incident report narrative stated that the driver of V1 claimed that her brakes had failed; however, an inspection of V1 revealed no such defect. The police speculated that after the initial impact, the driver of V1 kept her foot on the accelerator, thinking it was the brake.

The passenger in the parked vehicle was not injured.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when another vehicle encroached into her lane from a driveway, turning into the same direction. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to the driver of V1, although some associated factors were coded to her. First of all, the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for a parking lot. The passenger in the parked vehicle reported this, and the hard impact to V2 verified this. For this reason, the driver of V1 was also coded as driving aggressively. The driver of V1 was also unfamiliar with her vehicle - she told police that she had just rented the car from a rental agency. The driver of V1 had just left a doctor\'s office, and it was possible that she had received upsetting news or that she was late for another appointment. The driver of V1 cut her interview short, and so much information was unknown.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was when he began to turn left onto the roadway. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as inadequate surveillance, a recognition error. He told police that he never saw V1 approaching because it was going too fast. Although it was believed that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast, it was not believed that this was the reason that the driver of V2 did not see V1. It was believed that the driver of V2 failed to look to his right immediately before pulling out from his parking space. The driver of V2 reported that he took a prescription medication to lower his cholesterol, but had no other health issues. \n\nIn summary, the crash occurred when V2 pulled from a parking space and attempted to turn left onto a drive-through roadway. The driver of V2 reported that he did not see V1 prior to the crash. The driver of V1 contributed to the crash by traveling too fast for the roadway/parking lot. \n

On the other side of the intersection with the driveway, the center median became a left turn-only lane for the next intersection.  V2 (V2) was exiting the driveway parking lot.  The conditions were as follows: early afternoon, partly cloudy skies, and the roadways were dry.  The gradient for (V1) was level, while the grade for (V2) was a positive 2.5 percent slope.    The posted speed limit for V1 was 40 kmph (25 mph).  There were no speed limit signs for the parking lot driveway that V2 was exiting. V2 had a stop sign; V1 had no traffic control device.\n\nV1 was a 2003 Ford Focus traveling southbound, intending to continue straight at this driveway-intersection.  V2 was a 1994 Chevy Lumina minivan traveling east, intending to turn left to travel north.  V1 did not see V2 coming across her pathway and struck V2 in the left front, with the front of V1.\n\nThe driver of V1, a 21-year old female, did not have any injuries.  There was no driver interview obtained after numerous attempts to contact the driver.  V1 needed to be towed due to damage.  There was no vehicle inspection after numerous attempts to contact the driver, tow company, and the insurance company.  The police report did not indicate any drugs or alcohol being a factor in this crash.   The police reported V1 traveling at an unknown speed.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as: other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, turning into opposite direction.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was not coded to V1. Two associated factors were coded to the driver of V1 - an illegal maneuver due to driving on the median and a sight restriction due to stopped non-contact vehicles in the southbound lane. \n\nV2 was driven by a 20-year old female. The driver and passengers of V2 did not have any injuries.  There was no driver interview obtained after numerous attempts to contact the driver.  V1 did not need to be towed.  There was no vehicle inspection after numerous attempts to contact the driver, tow company, and the insurance company.  The police report did not indicate any drugs or alcohol being a factor in this crash.   The police reported V1 traveling at an unknown speed.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded as this vehicle turning left at the intersection.   The Critical Reason was coded as an "other" recognition error - the impending problem was masked by the traffic flow pattern (the vehicles in the southbound lane). One additional associated factor coded to the driver of V2 was a sight restriction due to the stopped vehicles in the southbound lane.  \n

The crash occurred on a north/south undivided two-lane roadway. The road was straight and dry and had a positive grade of 2.5 percent in the southbound direction. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph). The crash occurred in the mid-morning hours on a clear day.\n\nV1 was 1999 Toyota Camry that was traveling south.  V1 traveled off the roadway on the right side.  The front right corner of V1 struck a utility pole, coming to rest against the utility pole while the back of the car rotated back onto the roadway.  The driver, a 74-year old female, was taken to a nearby trauma hospital to be checked after striking the windshield with her head.  An interview over the phone was obtained and the driver explained that she was told that she had "blacked out." She also stated that she was very familiar with the area because she has lived there all her life.  The car needed to be towed due to the disabling damage. A witness had told police that the driver of V1 had not moved when its light had turned green on a nearby roadway. After several seconds, the driver of V1 finally initiated a left turn onto the southbound roadway,. It then traveled forward and within seconds, impacted the utility pole.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was when it traveled off the edge of the road on the right side.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as an illness (heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act). The driver also stated that she had heart and lung problems for which she took several medications. It was believed that one of the heart conditions caused the blackout. At the time of the crash, the driver of V1 was on her way to her doctor.  There were no other factors involved with this crash.   \n\n

The crash occurred while V1 (V1) was going westbound on a four-lane undivided roadway in the first lane of travel.  This roadway included a white dashed line to denote 2 lanes of travel per direction, with a double yellow solid line in the center.  Conditions were as follows: late morning, clear skies, and a completely dry roadway.  Just prior to the crash location, there was a traffic light for westbound traffic.  There was an uphill grade of 4 percent.  The speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph).\n\nV1 was 2002 Hyundai Elantra driven by a 48-year old male who experienced a seizure while driving.  V1 traveled off the roadway to the right side.  V1 went over a concrete curb and went up an embankment and struck a utility pole with the left side of the car.  The car came to rest against the utility pole while the back of the car was still up the embankment.  \n\nWhen the researcher arrived on scene, the four occupants were not there, and the police officer was very short during any conversation.  After obtaining the police report, it was noted that the driver was taken to a nearby hospital to be checked out.  The police report also indicated that the driver had a possible medical abnormality, which might have caused this crash. The car needed to be towed due to the damage. The researcher was not able to attain an interview with the driver of V1.  \n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as a "heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act," a critical non-performance error.  An associated factor coded to the driver was alcohol withdrawal, as the driver of V1 had a history of alcohol abuse. A blood test conducted at the hospital two and one-half hours after the crash was negative for both alcohol and drugs.   \n

The crash occurred on a three-lane undivided roadway with one lane westbound and two lanes eastbound. Conditions were as follows: early afternoon, clear skies, and a completely dry and level roadway.  Just prior to the crash location, there was a right curve in the westbound direction. The speed limit was unknown, because it was not on the police report and no signs were found near the crash location.\n\nV1 was 1995 Ford Escort 4-door station wagon driven by a 33-year old female. The driver of V1 was traveling westbound and had just finished negotiating the curve and was nearing a traffic light.  For an unknown reason, V1 traveled off the roadway on the right side and struck the guardrail with the right front of the vehicle.  V1 then spun in a counterclockwise direction, and struck the guardrail a second time with the left back of the car.  The car came to rest against the guardrail, facing in the opposite direction of traffic.\n\nWhen the researcher arrived on scene, the driver was there but leaving with a police officer, so there was no interview.  One of the remaining police officers on scene was able to provide a brief description of the crash.  V1 needed to be towed due to the damage. Although several attempts were made to contact the driver, no interview was obtained.  \n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was when it traveled off the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was an unknown driver error.  The police report indicated that the driver of V1 could provide no information on why she departed the roadway and struck the guardrail. No mechanical problems were found during the inspection of V1 and initial tow on scene.\n

This crash occurred at a four-way intersection.  The weather at the time was clear with no adverse conditions.  One roadway travels North and South, while the intersecting roadway travels East/West.  The East/West roadway is a two-way two-lane roadway. The North/South roadway is a two-way, two lane roadway, with a shoulder and a bike lane on each side.  Neither lane is physically divided.  Both lanes are leveled and have a posted speed limit of 40 kpmh (25 mph).\n\nV1 was a 1996 Chevrolet Blazer.  This vehicle was traveling eastbound, stopped, and was attempting to make a left-handed turn to go northbound at the intersection.  When the vehicle proceeded to turn the front of V1 contacted the left side of V2 causing V2 to lose control and hit a light pole.  V1 after impact pulled to the side of the North/South roadway.  V1 suffered scrapes on the front bumper, grill, fender and headlight.\n\nV2 was a 1994 Oldsmobile 88 Royale.  This vehicle was traveling westbound crossing through the intersection when it was contacted on its\' left side by V1.  V2 then lost control, striking a light pole on the northwest corner of the intersection. It came to rest on the northwest corner of the intersection\n\nThe driver of V1 states that while he was stopped at the intersection, there was a transit bus stopped in the opposite direction of travel.  The driver then states that the operator of the transit bus waved him on to turn.  Then as the driver was turning V2 came streaking by the right side of the transit bus, from the parking lane, into V1\'s path of travel.  The driver states that there was no way they could stop in time and they had no choice but to brake and strike V2. Driver of V1 takes medication for Diabetes Type II, and blood pressure.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded to V1 as, this vehicle traveling turning left at intersection.  The Critical Reason for Critical Pre-Crash Event was also coded to V1 as, turned with obstructed view.\n\nWe were unable to get a full interview from the driver of V2 due to the fact that he sought legal counsel after the crash, and we could not get permission from the counsel to speak to the driver.  The information we were able to get says that the driver of V2 was  trying to make a right hand turn at the intersection to go northbound.  When the driver attempted to turn they were struck on the left side by V1.  The driver of V2 was transported to a local hospital with unknown injuries.  V2 was towed due to damage on the left side, and left front of vehicle.  The Critical Pre-Crash Event was this vehicle turning right at intersection.  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle.\n\nIt is this researchers determination that V2 was not turning right at the intersection as the driver had stated, but instead was in fact coming around the bus as stated by driver of V1.  Also in the conversation with driver of V1 states that the driver of V2 had alcoholic beverages in the vehicle, though none were found or evident at time of inspection.

The crash occurred at a T-intersection on an eastbound/westbound roadway. V1 was traveling westbound on a five-lane (two westbound and two eastbound with a center turn lane) undivided roadway. V2 was traveling on a two-lane (one northbound and one southbound) undivided roadway. Both asphalt roadways were dry, level, and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit for both roadways was 40 kmph (25mph). The crash occurred in the early afternoon hours on a weekday. Traffic was heavy on the east/westbound roadway. \n\nV1, a 4-door 1999 Nissan Altima, was traveling westbound in lane #1 when it struck with its front end the left side of V2, a 4-door 1987 Buick Lesabre. V2 had been southbound on the intersecting roadway, and was attempting a left turn at the T-intersection. V2 had a stop sign posted at the corner of the T-intersection and had stopped before initiating its turn. According to the interview, the driver of V2 was attempting to merge into the oncoming traffic and didn\'t see the vehicle coming from her left. \n\nThe driver of V1, a 39-year old male, stated that there was a curve several feet before the intersection and it took away his ability to see V2 crossing in front of him. The driver of V1 was familiar with the roadway - he drove on it daily. The driver of V1 was not injured. V1 was not towed.\n\nThe driver of V2, a 91-year old female, stated that she couldn\'t understand why the driver of V1 couldn\'t see her merging into traffic. She stated that after the curve there were several feet of straight roadway before the T-intersection. V2\'s driver was familiar with the roadway - she drove it weekly. The driver of V2 was transported to a hospital with possible rib fractures. V2 was towed due to damages from the crash.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for the driver of V1 was when another vehicle encroached into his lane from a crossing street, turning into the opposite direction. The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V1, although one associated factor was coded to him. It was believed that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the roadway. When questioned, he reported that he was traveling between 31-40 mph. The posted speed limit was 25 mph. In determining if there was a sight line restriction, it was decided that at a posted speed of 25 mph, it was not a factor. Furthermore, since the driver of V1 drove on the roadway on a daily basis, he should have been familiar with any roadway limitations. \n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for the driver of V2 was when she began to turn left at the intersection. The Critical Reason for the Pre-Crash Event was coded to this driver as inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see). It was believed that the driver of V2 did stop at the intersection before entering the intersection; however, she did not see V1 approaching. One associated factor coded to this driver was the use of unidentified prescription medications for the treatment of high blood pressure and diabetes.  \n   \n

The motor vehicle accident occurred on a north/south roadway that had five travel lanes, three northbound, two southbound.  This roadway does not have a physical divider.  The surface was level, asphalt, and there were no traffic control devices at the scene. \n\nV1, a 2003 Ford Taurus driven by a 45-year old female, was traveling northbound on the roadway when the driver missed its turn off.  The driver made a U-turn and started to travel southbound on the roadway.  The driver intended to make a left hand turn into a parking lot, then cross through the lot to enter the roadway for which she missed the turn-off.  The driver waited in the southbound travel lane (in lane 2) for northbound traffic to allow her to enter the lot. A motorist in the second northbound lane and one in the third northbound lane stopped and waived the driver on.  The driver proceeded to cross the double yellow lines and cross over the northbound travel lanes to enter the lot.  After crossing over the first two lanes, the driver reported that a vehicle in the first lane of northbound traffic was traveling at a high rate of speed and crossed into the driver\'s path.  The driver also states that she had no way to avoid striking the vehicle (V2).\n\nV2, a 2001 Acura 3.2 CL coupe driven by a 26-year old male, was traveling north in the first lane of travel. He stated that he had begun to slow down because traffic ahead of him had slowed for a red light further up the road. The driver of V2 stated that as he was approaching the stopped traffic, V1 came out of nowhere and hit the left side of his vehicle. He accelerated and steered to the right, but the front of V1 then hit the rear of his vehicle.  \n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for the driver of V1 was coded as This vehicle traveling - turning left at intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was an othe decision error - turned with obstructed view. Associated factors coded to this driver include a sight restriction caused by the non-contact vehicles whose drivers waived V1 on, and a false assumption - the driver of V1 assumed that because the two non-contact drivers were waiving her on, that the way must be clear.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for the driver of V2 was when another vehicle encroached into his lane from the opposite direction - over the left lane line. The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V2. One associated factor coded to him was the sight restriction due to the stopped (no-contact) vehicles. \n

The accident occurred in the early afternoon hours in the middle of an intersection of two one-way streets. Both roadways were controlled by traffic signals that were operating properly in both directions.  Both roadways were dry, straight, and level. The weather was clear.  \n\nV1, a 2003 Suzuki motorcycle, was traveling north on the northbound roadway.  V2, a 1998 Honda Civic coupe, was traveling west on the westbound roadway. V1 and V2 entered the intersection at approximately the same time, and V1 struck the left side of V2 at about the "B" pillar.  The driver of V1 was ejected after impact and was thrown approximately 20 feet, landing on the asphalt.  V2 came to rest facing southbound in the southwest corner of the intersection.\n\nThe operator of V1, a 46-year old male, was transported to the hospital with major injuries.  Later that day, the driver of V1 was pronounced deceased at the hospital from injuries sustained in the crash.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across path."  The Critical Reason for Critical Pre-Crash Event was not coded to this vehicle. According to witnesses, V1 entered the intersection on a green light. Due to the death of the driver of V1, no associated factors could be coded to V1.\n\nV2 was driven by a 21-year old male who entered the intersection on a red light. It was not known why he did not stop - no interview was obtained. The driver was transported to the hospital with moderate injuries.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V2 was coded "this vehicle traveling - crossing over (passing through) intersection."  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded as an illegal maneuver - failed to stop for traffic control device.  This vehicle, according to witnesses, entered the intersection on a steady red signal. No interview was obtained from the driver of V2, and so no associated factors could be coded to V2.\n

This motor vehicle crash took place on a two-lane roadway.  This roadway has a set of rail tracks dividing the two lanes.  The roadway runs north/south with one lane in each direction and the posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph).  The north/south roadway was not controlled by any TCD\'s (traffic control devices).\n\nV1, a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Sport Utility Vehicle, was traveling northbound in lane one.  V2, a 2001 Hyundai Sonata, came out of a parking lot onto northbound lane one, attempting to turn right.  V1 was unable to stop and ended up striking the left side of V2 with its front end.  Both vehicles came to rest.\n\nNo interview was obtained from the driver of V1, a 26-year old female. According to an eyewitness account, V1 was traveling at about 30mph. V2 pulled out of the lot carelessly, not looking in either direction nor making a full stop at the stop sign while exiting the parking lot. The eyewitness was in a vehicle traveling behind V1 at time of the crash.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for the driver of V1 was when the other vehicle encroached into her lane from a driveway, turning into the same direction. The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V1. Due to the lack of an interview, no other information was known about the driver of V1 or her actions.\n\nNo interview was obtained from the driver of V2, an 82-year old male.  According to the eyewitness, V2 pulled out from the parking lot at about 10- 15 mph.  \n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for the driver of V2 was when he began to turn right at the intersection.  The Critical Reason For the Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded as "Type of driver error unknown," due to the lack of an interview. It may have been a surveillance issue, a misjudgment of the other\'s speed, or even a false assumption. Since the reason for the actions of V2 could not be ascertained, the Critical Reason had to be coded as an unknown driver error.  No other information about the driver of V2 was known.

This motor vehicle crash occurred on a major highway.  That day there were no adverse conditions, it happened around sunset, and there were no streetlights on at the time.  The highway is a twelve-lane highway that runs north/south - six lanes in each direction, with the six lanes divided into groups of three by grassy medians with curb edges that border the roadside.\n\nThe crash involved only one vehicle, a 2005 Ford Escape Sport Utility Vehicle, which rolled over.  It was traveling in lane two of the center southbound lanes.  The Ford lost control and struck the curb at the edge of the roadway, causing it to trip over onto the grass median.  The vehicle came to rest on its roof leaning against a tree.\n\nThe driver of V1, a 51-year old female, stated that she was driving in the center southbound lane (lane two) when a vehicle in lane three tried to encroach into V1\'s lane.  After two attempts by the vehicle in lane three to try to enter V1\'s lane, it entered into V1\'s lane of travel, forcing V1 to change lanes abruptly to lane one.  The driver of V1 stated that she tried to regain control but was unsuccessful. She believes she rolled over 2-3 times before waking up upside down inside the vehicle and someone asking her to get out of the vehicle.  The driver could not recall exactly when the vehicle started its rollover sequence and feels that she may have blacked out as a result of the forces being applied by the rollover sequence.  The driver of V1 was wearing her seatbelt and refused treatment initially but was then transported to the hospital for a check-up.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded as "This vehicle loss of control due to other cause of control loss," specified as "avoidance maneuver." This was chosen because a witness verified to police the presence and actions of the no-contact vehicle (cutting off V1).  The Critical Reason For the Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded as overcompensation, a performance error. The driver in the interview stated that she had waited for traffic to die down before heading home because she hates all the traffic on the highway.  She also stated that she tries to avoid this highway as much as she can. This was coded as an experience-related associated factor. Another factor coded to this driver was the use of a prescription allergy medication.

The following crash took place in the middle of a 4-way intersection.  The east/west roadway is a one-way street going west, with a stop sign visible approaching the intersection.  The crossing street is a two-way not physically divided roadway, this roadway has no TCD (traffic control device) at the intersection.\n\nThe driver of V1 a 2000 Ford F-150 was traveling northbound and V2 a 1996 Ford Taurus was traveling westbound.  V2 stopped at the stop sign and because of her obstructed view slowly drove into the intersection.  V1\'s view was also obstructed by the same parked vehicle and was unable to see V2 pulling into the intersection. V1\'s front contacted V2 in the left side.  V2 continued across the street and contacted a parked vehicle in the left side.\n\nThe driver of V1 states that he was traveling northbound.  As they approached the intersection a vehicle (V2) had made a rolling stop through the stop sign right into their lane of travel.  The driver states that at the speed they were going there was nothing they could do so they slammed on the brakes and struck V2 with the front end of the vehicle.  They also said that there was a vehicle blocking the driver\'s sight of vision to the intersecting roadway.  The driver stated that, had that car not been there they would have probably seen the vehicle and slowed down.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded to this vehicle as:  other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, across path.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was not coded to this vehicle.\n\nThe driver of V2 stated that she was traveling westbound approaching the intersection.  She state that they came to the intersection and made a complete stop at the intersection.

The accident this day took place on a two-lane, undivided north/south roadway at a T-intersection with an east/west roadway.  The east/west roadway intersected the north/south roadway at about a 25-30 degree angle.  The east/west roadway was controlled by a stop sign, while the north/south roadway had no traffic control device.  The posted speed limit on the north/south roadway was 40 kmph (25 mph), and the east/west roadway was posted at 32 kmph (20 mph). V1, a 1996 Ford Taurus, was traveling north. V2, a 1995 Isuzu Rodeo, was traveling west. At the time of the crash, it was raining heavily and the roadway was wet.\n\nThe driver of V1, a male of unknown age, was driving his two daughters to school.  He stated that he was following a non-contact vehicle as he approached the T-intersection.  The driver of V1 stated that the vehicle in front of him made a right hand turn into the eastbound roadway.  The driver of V1 attempted to go around the non-contact vehicle as it made its right turn. As he did so, V2, which had been stopped facing west at the stop sign, pulled out onto the north/south roadway, intending to turn left. The left front corner of V1 impacted the left rear side of V2. After being struck by V1, V2 was rotated in a counterclockwise direction, striking a utility pole aft the "C" pillar on the right side of the vehicle.  V2 came to rest against the pole facing east. \n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as "Other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, turning into opposite direction."  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was not coded to this vehicle. Associated factors coded to this driver include the non-contact vehicle in front of V1 that partially blocked V1\'s driver from seeing the actions of V2, the heavy rain, and the wet roadway. The driver of V1 stated that one of his daughters had a school trip that day and that was why he was driving them to school.  The driver stated that the two children were belted and secured in the back seat and were not causing any distraction at time of the accident.\n\nThis researcher was unable to get in contact with the driver of V2, a 25-year old female.The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V2 was coded as "This vehicle turning left at intersection."  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to this vehicle was "type of driver error unknown."  This was chosen because of the absence of an interview with the driver of V2. Due to the lack of an interview, the only known associated factors that were coded to this driver were the weather (the heavy rain) and the wet roadway.\n\n \n

The crash occurred in the early evening hours while still daylight at a T-intersection.  The main street was an east/west two-lane two-way roadway with no traffic control. The posted speed limit was 40 KMPH (25 MPH). The crossing street ran north/south and ended at the T-intersection.  The north/south roadway was a two-lane two-way roadway controlled by a stop sign. The east west roadway had a shoulder on either side, which diminished as it neared the intersection.  The roadway was divided by two solid yellow lines.  There were no adverse weather conditions that day and both roadways were dry.   \n\nV1, a 1998 Ford Taurus station wagon, was driven by a 20-year old female. V1 was traveling west on the east/west roadway. V2, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, was driven by a 24-year old female. V2 was traveling south on the north/south roadway. According to police and witness reports, the driver of V2 came to a complete stop at her stop sign, facing south.  The driver of V2 then entered the intersection and attempted to turn left to travel east on the east/west roadway.  As V2 entered the intersection, its left side was struck by the front right of V1. The momentum of V1 pushed V2 off of the roadway and down the east/west roadway traveling westbound, coming to rest approximately 51.6m from impact in the eastbound lanes.  V1 rolled off of the sidewalk and came to rest facing south in the middle of the two east/west lanes.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, turning into opposite direction." The Critical Reason For the Critical Pre-Crash Event was not coded to V1, although excess speed was coded as an associated factor. A witness who had been traveling behind V1 reported that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to impact. The extent of damage to V2 and the post-impact trajectory of the vehicles supported the claim of excess speed, as the posted speed limit was 40 KMPH (25 MPH). All other information was unknown due to the lack of an interview with the driver of V1.\n\nThe Critical Pre Crash Event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling - turning left at intersection."  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded as "Type of driver error unknown," due to the lack of an interview. \n

This crash occurred in the evening, the weather that evening was clear with no adverse conditions, the roadway was dry.  It took place on a major highway.  The highway travels east/west.  It consists of six total travel lanes, three in each direction, divided by a physical median with a positive barrier.  The two vehicles contacted in the westbound lanes while coming off the on-ramp, the on-ramp was not a factor (they were both on the roadway at the bottom).  The on-ramp had a yield sign at the bottom where the roadway levels out.\n\nV2 was stopped at the bottom of the on-ramp waiting for traffic at the yield sign.  V1 was also trying to merge into traffic, but did not notice V2 stopped at the bottom of the ramp due to being distracted by traffic on the roadway, driver of V1 was trying to merge into.  After V1 contacted the rear of V2 with its\' front they both came to rest in the merging traffic lane.\n\nThe operator of V1 states that he thought the operator of V2 had already merged into traffic. Driver of V1 was paying attention to the other traffic and never saw that V2 had not merged into traffic as he had thought.  V1 rear- ended V2 at the bottom of the ramp.  \n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event was coded other motor vehicle in lane other vehicle stopped.  The Critical Reason for Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as, recognition error inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see).  A possible factor is that driver of V1 had only had 2 hours sleep the night before and had felt fatigued.\n\nThe driver of V2 states that she was stopped completely at the bottom of the ramp waiting to merge into traffic. The driver states, that while she was waiting for traffic, more than 10 seconds, she was struck from behind by V1.  She suffered no injuries.   \n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded other motor vehicle in land traveling in same direction with higher speed.  There was no Critical reason coded to this vehicle.  The driver of this vehicle has a hyperopic (far-sighted) condition, she does not need her glasses to drive.  This was thought not to be a factor in the crash.\n\nBoth drivers are students at a local university, they both were in there \xe2\x80\x9cfinals\xe2\x80\x9d week.  Driver of V1 stated that he had been up late the night prior studying.\n\nOther Factors: Although neither driver clearly stated, I feel that both drivers were concerned about their exams.  They both attend the same university about one mile away from the accident scene.  It was the week for final exams.

This motor vehicle accident took place mid-block, on a two-way, four lane highway in the early hours of the morning (daylight).  The highway runs east/west; it has a shoulder on either side and also a bike lane on either side.  A concrete non-positive barrier physically divides this highway.  There is slight elevation in both directions and the posted speed limit in each direction is 48 kmph (30mph).\n\nV1 is a 1992 Toyota Corolla.  This vehicle was traveling eastbound on this east/west highway.  The driver crossed onto the raised concrete center curb median into westbound traffic and then steered back into the eastbound lanes.  The driver then crossed over both eastbound lanes of traffic, traveling onto the sidewalk and then striking the guardrail located on the right roadside.  V1 came to rest on the sidewalk approximately 15 meters from its impact point with the guardrail.  \n\nThe driver, a 24-year old female, stated that she was on her way to a medical clinic to pick up medication - she was recovering from a drug addiction. The driver had stopped at the light at the previous intersection and when the light turned green, she started to proceed normally when her left front wheel was "slipping. It kept turning, I tried to straighten the wheel back when I crossed the curb (divider).  Next thing I know I\'m looking at the traffic coming at me, I was scared.  I closed my eyes - that\'s all I remember."  Physical evidence at the scene showed no distinguishable markings on the concrete median that could be linked to the vehicle.  However, there were markings on the right side curb, tread marks in the grass where the driver departed the roadway, and paint transfer on the guardrail.  The driver was transported to a trauma center for multiple contusions and a fractured nose.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event was when the driver of V1 departed the roadway on the right side. The Critical Reason for The Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded as "poor directional control; e.g. failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected," a performance error. Associated factors coded to the driver include fatigue (driver had only 5 hours of sleep in the last 24 hours) combined with the use of a prescription medication that had the possible side effects of dizziness and fatigue, and driver inexperience (she had only a learner\'s permit). The driver also claimed that she was uncomfortable with the steering on the vehicle - she stated that the wheel kept "sticking."

He looked in all directions before continuing and noticed V2, a 1992 Toyota 4 door Camry stopped at the corner of the intersection heading westbound.  \n\nThe driver of V1, a 38year old male, stated that he believed that he made eye contact with the driver of V2, a 53-year-old female, before he proceeded. He said that it was stop and go for several seconds, he\'d take off slowly and put on brakes and then the driver of V2 would do the same. It happened a few times before he actually applied the gas and accelerated quickly. He assumed she was going to let him go first. He said that he did not have time to react or stop fast enough to prevent hitting V2. All he could do was hit the brakes before he impacted the right side of V2 with his font-end.\n\nThe driver of V2 couldn\'t be contacted for an interview. She was transported to the hospital for observation. She told the police that she was not injured. She was just shaken-up and scared. V2 was towed due to damages from the crash.\n\nThe driver of V1 was obviously shaken-up as a result of the crash. However, decided not to be transported to the hospital. He was more concerned with getting into a crash with his uncles car. The car that he was driving belonged to his uncle and he reluctantly gave me the interview because he had to deal with his uncle. He admitted that he had been in a few crashes before. He said that his uncle thinks that he is a bit of a reckless driver. He is familiar with the roadway and the vehicle and has been a driver for several years.\n \nThe Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle crossing over (passing though) the intersection, and the Critical Precrash Reason was also coded for this vehicle, V1 false assumption of the other\'s actions. It is the researchers opinion that the driver of V1 did stop for the stop sign before entering the intersection, however, did not proceeded at a considerable speed which would have allowed him to respond to the other drivers actions. V2 was impacted on its right side at the B pillar, mid car, and the distance from the corner/ stop sign is approximately 100 ft which is enough distance to react to a critical moment. \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across path.

The V2 crash occurred in the middle of a T-intersection. The roadways for both vehicles were asphalt, dry, and level. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph) for both directions. V1 (V1) had a stop sign controlling its direction; there was no control device for V2 (V2). The crash occurred in the early afternoon on a weekday. The traffic flow was light and the weather was clear.\n\nV1, a 2005 Ford Expedition, was traveling westbound and stopped at the corner, adhering to the passive stop sign located on both sides of the corner. She said she looked both ways before making her intended right turn; however, her view was obstructed by several vehicles parked on the southeast corner. She accelerated into the intersection and the front of her vehicle contacted the right front of V2, a 1992 Pontiac Bonneville.  \n\nThe driver of V1, a 21-year old female, was aware of the posted stop sign, and said that she felt comfortable with the rented vehicle. She gave no other explanation for the crash besides her inability to see the traffic to her left. After the initial impact, V1 continued traveling north for a few feet and spun around 45 degrees clockwise before striking a narrow pole on the northeast corner of the intersection, where it came to final rest.   \n\nThe driver of V2, a 26-year old female, stated that she had the right of way and didn\'t see V1 until the last second and she then applied her brakes. She was issued a citation for driving without proof of insurance. Although V2 was towed, police logged the crash as a non-reportable accident.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was when it began to turn right at the intersection. The Critical Reason was coded as inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see). Associated factors coded to this driver include a sightline restriction caused by the parked vehicles on the side of the roadway and unfamiliarity with both her vehicle and the roadway.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, turning into same direction.

V1 was towed due to damages.\n\nThe driver of V1, a 21-year old female was visibly shaken. She said she was driving south and was aware of the cobblestone and how slippery it gets when it rains. Her travel speed she said was approximately 48 kmph (30mph). She was attempting to avoid contacting another vehicle to her left and turned to the right while traversing a curve right and lost control because the cobblestone, was wet. The driver first, was not interested in being transported to the hospital. However, deciding after her mother arrived at the scene to be transported.  \n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded control loss due to rain and wet cobblestone, while negotiating a curve. The Critical Reason was as a decision error driving to fast on wet cobblestone while traversing a curve. The associated factor is driving slightly over the speed limit.  Another associated factor is the road design; possible speed limit and the surface condition of cobblestone when wet.  This road has been paved over with asphalt since this crash.\n

This crash took place during the early afternoon of a weekday at an intersection of two roads and a driveway controlled by a traffic signal.  The bituminous, dry north/south roadway was two-way, undivided and had four lanes with a posted speed of 56kmph (35 mph).  The west roadway was two-way undivided with three lanes.  \n\nV1, a 2005 Dodge Caravan, was stopped for the red signal preparing to turn right from the driveway exit.  V2, a 2000 Ford Expedition, was traveling north in lane two, approaching the intersection while negotiating a slight curve left.  V3, a 2000 Saturn SL2, was traveling south in lane two approaching the same intersection.  V4, a 1997 GMC C-series truck, was traveling south in lane one.   As V1 turned right on the red signal and attempted to enter lane two it was struck by V2.  V2 rotated approximately 30 degrees counterclockwise, crossing the centerline contacting V3.  V3 was than pushed into lane one where it was struck in the back plane by V4.\n\nV1 was driven by a 59 year-old female who claimed to be in fair health and was wearing her glasses that corrected a hyperopic (far-sighted) condition.  She stated that she was conversing with an occupant about recent financial problems just prior to initiating the turn right.  She also stated that she saw V2 but thought that she had time to pull out and complete the turn.  Both occupants suffered possible injuries and were transported for treatment.  V1 was towed from the scene.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for this vehicle was coded as this vehicle traveling, turning right at intersection.  The Critical Reason was coded as a decision error: misjudgment of gap or other\'s speed.  Associated factors include driver inattention as she was conversing with the passenger in her vehicle as well as the financial problem on her mind.\n\nV2 was driven by a 44 year-old male in good health but fatigued as he was heading home.  He stated that he was driving a little fast but saw V1 and did not think that the vehicle would attempt the turn until he passed.  His vehicle collided with V1 as he traveled through the intersection.  The driver was uninjured but V2 was towed due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for this vehicle was coded as other vehicle encroachment (from driveway, turning into the same direction).  A critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.  Associated factors for this crash were the driver\'s fatigue as well as traveling too fast for conditions as the driver stated he was in a hurry to just get home.\n\nV3 was driven by a 22 year-old female who sustained fatal injuries on scene.  The Critical Precrash Event was coded as other (not involved in first harmful event) and a critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.  This vehicle was towed due to damage.\n\nV4 was driven by a 43 year-old male who refused to be interviewed.  This vehicle was not involved in first harmful event and not thought to have contributed to the crash.  \n \n\n\n\n

\n\nThis crash took place at the intersection of a two way, three lane undivided roadway and a parking lot exit.  Conditions were daylight and dry shortly after noon on a holiday weekend.  The bituminous roadway had a posted speed limit of 35mph (56kmph).  V1, a 1993 Mazda Prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, was leaving a parked position and stopped at the driveway exit waiting to make a left turn into southbound traffic.  V2, a 1991 Honda Accord Wagon, was traveling north in lane two approaching the parking lot exit.  A NCV was also traveling north in lane one, approaching the parking lot entrance preparing to turn into it.  The NCV initiated its turn at roughly the same as V1 attempted to enter the trafficway partially obscuring each vehicle\'s view of one another.  As V1 traveled across lane two it was stuck by the front lane of V2.\n\nV1 was driven by a 38 year-old female who stated that she was in an argument with her occupant that began as they entered the parked vehicle.  She further stated that as she initiated her left turn, she saw the NCV but she did not see V2.  She was transported with minor injuries and the vehicle was towed due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for this vehicle was coded as this vehicle turning, turning left at intersection.  The Critical Reason was coded a recognition error, internal distraction as she was fighting with her husband at the time of the crash.  An associated factor is a sightline restriction as the turning NCV partially blocked V1 view of oncoming traffic. \n\nV2 was driven by a 28 year-old male who was unable to be located for an interview.  V2\'s driver was not injured and drove away from the scene.  This vehicle was not located for inspection.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for this vehicle was coded as other vehicle encroachment, from driveway- turning in opposite direction.  A critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.  A possible associated factor for this vehicle was the sightline restriction caused by the NCV.  \n\n

V1, a 2003 Jeep Liberty compact SUV, was traveling northbound in lane 1 of a 2-way, 2 lane, straight, bituminous roadway.  At the time of the crash the roadway was dry, it was dark and there were no adverse weather conditions.  A non-contact vehicle, headed northbound also, was stopped in the roadway waiting for traffic to clear so it could turn left at an uncontrolled intersection.  V1 braked and steered right in an effort to avoid striking the NC vehicle in the rear.  V1 exited the roadway to the right, entered the ditch where it struck a metal post with it\'s front.  V1 continued off- road striking a the edge of a driveway with it\'s front and ramping into the air.  V1, front, then struck a 4" by 4" sign post and landed with it\'s right side against some brush.\n\n  The female driver and the male passenger were uninjured.  Both occupants were restrained but no airbags deployed.  The driver possessed a valid driver\'s license, was familiar with the vehicle and the roadway. The driver was conversing with the passenger as she approached the stopped, turning vehicle.  She had turned her head away from the road to talk then looked back to see the vehicle stopped in front of her. Neither drugs nor alcohol were a factor in the crash.\n\n  The vehicle was towed due to damage.  V1 was found to have no mechanical defects which may have contributed to the crash.

V2, a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am, was traveling northbound in the right lane on a fully controlled, divided highway. The grassy median sloped downward and had a center metal guardrail. The two-lane, straight, level, bituminous roadway was wet at the time of the daylight (mid-morning) crash.  A non-contact vehicle moved from lane two into the right lane in front of V2.  V2 swerved into lane two to avoid contact with this non-contact vehicle.  \n\nV1, a 2001 Buick Century, was traveling northbound in lane two of the same roadway, and had no time for avoidance maneuvers.  The left back of V2 struck the right front of V1. V2 spun counterclockwise and went off of the roadway on the left with the right side leading.  V2 rocked up onto the right side wheels and continued to rotate until the back of V2 contacted the guardrail.  The left front of V2 sustained damage from contact with the ditch.  V2 rotated to the left and came to rest facing northwest near the guardrail.\n\nV1 steered left at impact with V2 and lost control.  V1 steered right and rotated clockwise and went off of the road to the left.  V1 rotated back to the left and came to a stop facing north near the guardrail, past the final rest of V2. V2 was towed from the scene due to damage.  V1 was towed from the ditch and to a tow facility, but was drivable.  No airbags deployed during the crash. Both drivers declined medical treatment. \n\nThe driver of V1 was a 51-year old female. The Critical Precrash Event for this driver was when another vehicle encroached into her lane from an adjacent lane (same direction) over the right lane line. The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V1 and she was not thought to have contributed to the crash. She had taken no medications on the day of the crash and was wearing her prescription lenses that corrected both myopic and hyperopic conditions. \n\nThe driver of V2 was a 26-year old male. The Critical Precrash Event for this driver was when he traveled over the lane line on the left side of his travel lane. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as inadequate surveillance, a recognition factor. This was chosen because the driver reported that he was looking at the non-contact vehicle and in avoiding that vehicle, he changed lanes without looking over to his left. His focus on the non-contact vehicle was coded as an associated factor, as an "other" recognition factor.  There were no reported alcohol, drugs, sleep, emotional, health, environmental, or mechanical factors contributing to the crash.  Both drivers were familiar with their vehicles and with the roadway.

V1, a 1995 Toyota Camry 4 door sedan, was westbound in lane 2 of a 6 lane undivided straight, level urban roadway (3 lanes eastbound, 3 lanes westbound). V1 was approaching a controlled 4-way intersection with a north/south roadway.  V2, a 1992 Honda Accord station wagon, was stopped in lane 3 of an undivided, 5-lane urban roadway (1 northbound, 4 southbound) facing south, at the same controlled intersection.  V3, a 2005 Ford Escape SUV, was stopped beside V2 in the second lane of travel, also facing south at the same intesection.  When the light turned green, V2 and V3 accelerated to proceed straight through the intersection.  V1 continued to proceed straight through the intersection on a red light.  V1\'s front contacted the left side of V2.  The force of this impact forced V2\'s right side into the left side of V3.  At the time of the daylight crash, there were no adverse weather conditions and the roads were dry. Vehicles 2 and 3 were towed due to damage.  V1 was driven from the scene.  None of the occupants in any of the three vehicles were injured.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded \xe2\x80\x9cOther vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across path.\xe2\x80\x9d The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle; however, several associated factors were coded to its driver. First, an illegal maneuver was coded (running a red light). A complete interview with the driver of V1, a 53-year old male, as well as an inspection of his vehicle was obtained at the scene.  The driver was found to be familiar with both the roadway and the vehicle as well as properly licensed for the vehicle.  He was not late or in a hurry and speed did not seem to be a factor.  There were no indications of fatigue or aggressive driving on his part but he was cited for running a red light. When questioned, the driver of V1 stated that he was not distracted by anything; however, he thought he had a green light as he entered the intersection. An associated factor coded to this driver was inadequate surveillance, because he failed to look before entering the intersection. The driver of V1 was taking a diabetes medication that had no known performance-impairing side effects. He was wearing his prescription lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition to a level of 20/10. The vehicle inspection yielded no indications that mechanical defects contributed to the causation of the crash. \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was coded \xe2\x80\x9cThis vehicle traveling - crossing over (passing through) intersection.\xe2\x80\x9d The Critical Reason was coded as inadequate surveillance, because the driver of V2 failed to look to either side ahead before entering the intersection. A complete interview with the driver of V2, a 55-year old female, was obtained at the scene and the vehicle was later inspected.   The driver was found to be familiar with both the roadway and the vehicle and was running a short errand at the time of the crash.  She was not late and not in a hurry and was properly licensed for her vehicle.  There were no indications of fatigue, aggressive driving or vehicle defects as contributing to the cause of the crash. She was wearing her prescription lenses (bifocals) that corrected both myopic and hyperopic conditions.\n\nNo Critical Precrash Event and no Critical Reason were coded to the driver of V3 because she was not involved in the first harmful event (the impact between the front of V1 and the left side of V2).  The driver of V3, a 64-year old female, was not thought to have contributed to the crash. A complete interview with the driver of V3 and an inspection of that vehicle were obtained.  The properly licensed driver of V3 was familiar with both the roadway and vehicle.  She was taking three prescription medications - a blood pressure medication, a cholesterol-lowering medication, and an antihistamine. Only the antihistamine had any possible performance-impairing side effects (drowsiness). The driver of V3 was wearing her prescription lenses at the time of the crash, which correct a hyperopic (farsighted) condition to a level of 20/20. When the crash occurred, the driver of V3 was running errands and was not late or in a hurry. There were no indications of aggressive driving or fatigue on the part of the driver of V3.  The inspection of V3 revealed no indications that its mechanical condition contributed to the causation of the crash.  \n\n  \n

V1, a 1995 Ford F250 pick-up truck pulling a horse trailer, was traveling eastbound on an undivided two-lane straight and level roadway.  V2, a 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix, was traveling on the same road in front of V1.  At the time of the crash it was clear and dry in the early afternoon hours. The posted speed limit was 80 kmph (50 mph). The driver of V2, a 54-year old female, began to slow in response to backed-up traffic ahead of her that was waiting to turn left onto an intersecting street.  The driver of V1, a 35-year old male, was traveling approximately 19 feet behind V2, and was looking out of his right side window at a store.  When the driver of V1 looked forward again at the road ahead, V2 was almost stopped in front of him.  The driver of V1 attempted to brake and steer to the right, but stated that the vehicle did not seem to respond.  The front of V1 struck the back of V2, overriding the rear bumper.  The trailer towed by V1 was fully loaded with 112 bags of pine shavings that did not shift during the crash.  The total weight of the cargo was 2,000 lbs.  V1 and V2 both came to a stop on the shoulder of the road facing east.  Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage. \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when another vehicle was in his lane in front of him traveling in the same direction while decelerating.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was an external distraction (looking at a store) that was coded to this vehicle. An associated factor coded to this driver was inadequate surveillance, in that he failed to look far enough ahead prior to the crash. If he had done so, he would have noticed that traffic ahead of V2 was in the process of slowing. Also, traffic was heavy at the time of the crash, and he should have expected slow-downs. Another associated factor coded to V1 was that the driver of V1 had helped to load the cargo, but had failed to utilize the available brakes on the trailer. The driver of V1 was familiar with the roadway and his vehicle, and was wearing his prescription lenses at the time of the crash, which corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition to a level of 20/20.  He was not fatigued and was taking no medications. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests. \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was when another motor vehicle was in the same lane behind V2, traveling at a higher speed.  The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V2 and she was not thought to have contributed to the crash.  The driver of V2 was being treated for hypertension and irregular heartbeat and was taking a medication with no known performance-impairing side effects. She was wearing glasses at the time of the crash that corrected an unknown condition. An associated factor coded to both drivers was the traffic congestion on the roadway that caused traffic ahead of V1 to slow down.\n

V1, 1999 Ford Contour 4dr, was traveling west on a 3-lane interstate divided by a concrete median barrier (6 lanes total) in the third lane of travel. The bituminous roadway curved to the right, and at the time of the crash, was ice-covered.  The crash occurred in the predawn hours of the morning and the roadway was not illuminated. V2, 2000 Ford Ranger pickup truck, was merging westbound onto the same roadway in lane 1.  The driver of V2, a 51-year old female, lost control and began to rotate clockwise and then counterclockwise as she crossed the left lane line into lane 2.  The driver of V1, a 20-year old female, saw V2 begin to lose control and began braking in response. As she braked, she too lost control. V1 rotated clockwise over the right lane line into lane 2.  The left side of V1 was struck by the front left of V2 while both were spinning on the ice in lane 2. V1 was towed due to damage.  The bumper of V2 was pulled away from the front left tire and V2 was driven from the scene.  Neither driver was injured. Complete interviews and inspections were obtained for both vehicles.  \n\n  The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when she lost control of her vehicle due to poor road conditions. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as "too fast for conditions to be able to respond to unexpected actions of other road users," a decision error. The icy condition of the roadway was coded as an associated factor. Even though V2 lost control first and the driver of V1 was simply reacting to V2 when she lost control, it was thought that had V1 maintained control of her vehicle she would not have entered the second lane of travel and the crash might not have occurred. In other words, had V1 been traveling at a slower speed, she might not have lost control when she braked and would have remained in her own lane (lane 3). Instead, V1 skidded into lane 2 where it was struck by V2. The driver of V1 had been traveling on this roadway for some time and was familiar with both her vehicle and the roadway. She knew that the roadway was ice-covered. Even though she claimed to be traveling at a speed well below the posted limit, it is likely that this was still too fast for the roadway, given its condition at the time. Possible under inflation of V1\'s tires were found during the inspection, otherwise, no other mechanical defects were detected.  The driver was properly licensed for the vehicle and was not in a hurry and no drug or alcohol involvement was evident. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests. No citations were issued to either driver.\n \n  The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was also when she lost control of her vehicle due to poor road conditions. Although the Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V2, she was believed to have contributed to the crash. It was believed that V2 was also traveling too fast for conditions. While she may not have been aware of the condition of the interstate because she was just entering it from the ramp when she lost control, she was still traveling too fast. It had snowed earlier in the day and some of that snow remained on the roads, packed down and now ice-covered. As with V1, the condition of the roadway was coded as an associated factor. There appeared to be no fatigue or emotional factors on the part of the driver of V2.  The driver was both properly licensed for and familiar with the vehicle and the roadway.  She reported that she was not in a hurry. She stated that she had prescription glasses to correct a hyperopic (farsighted) condition but was not wearing them at the time of the crash. She reported that she was taking no medications. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests. No citations were issued to either driver.\n\n   It should be noted that over 20 vehicles lost control on this same stretch of roadway in a 1-hour period and it was difficult to see the ice, as it was in intermittent patches.

V1, a 2004 Lexus ES330, was southbound on a two-lane undivided roadway (one lane each direction) slowing to look for a parking space.  V2, a 1998 Gillig Low Floor bus was traveling behind V1 on the same roadway in the same direction. It was the late hours of the evening and it was dark outside, but the straight, level, slush-covered roadway was illuminated by streetlamps. The driver of V1 noticed a parking space on the opposite side of the street and decided to make a U-turn in order to turn his vehicle around and park on the other side of the street. In preparation of making this U-turn, he pulled as far to the right side of the roadway as he could while decelerating. The driver of V2 saw V1 pull to the right and assumed that the driver of V1 would wait for the bus to pass before initiating the U-turn. As the bus began to pass V1 on the left, the driver of V1 initiated the U-turn. The front right corner of the bus impacted the left side of V1 in the opposing lane of traffic.  The driver of V2 had braked and steered left when he realized what V1 was doing, and struck a legally parked vehicle that was parked on the opposite side of the street with its front left.  V1 rotated back southbound and the left side of V1 came to rest against the right side of V2. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage.  V2 was drivable after the crash. The left rear passenger of V1 was transported to the local trauma center; the driver and other two passengers of V1 denied any injuries.  The driver and 10 adult passengers of V2 denied injuries.  V1 was equipped with driver, right front and side curtain airbags, which did not deploy.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when this vehicle began traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as an illegal maneuver, a decision error. The driver of V1 was cited for making an illegal U-turn.  Several associated factors were coded to the driver of V1. First, he falsely assumed that the bus, which he knew was behind him, would stay behind him until he completed his U-turn. Second, before beginning his U-turn, he did not check his rear mirrors again to locate the bus (inadequate surveillance). Third, he was focusing on the parking space on the other side of the street (exterior distraction). Fourth, he was distracted by conversations with and among his passengers. At the time of the crash, the driver of V1 was wearing his prescription lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition. He was taking no medications, was not fatigued, and was familiar with both his vehicle and the roadway. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was also when it began traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane.  The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V2; however, he was thought to have contributed to the crash. When the driver of V2 observed V1 decelerating and pulling over to the right, he correctly interpreted the actions of V1 as being in preparation of making a U-turn. However, he falsely assumed that the driver of V1 would wait until V2 passed V1 before initiating its turn. Further, the driver of V2 received a citation from the police for improper passing. Therefore, an illegal maneuver was coded as an associated factor, as well as a false assumption.   At the time of the crash, the driver of V2 was wearing his prescription lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition. He was taking no medications, was not fatigued, and was familiar with both his vehicle and the roadway. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.  \n\nIn summary, the crash occurred when the driver of V1 attempted an illegal U-turn in front of V2, whose driver falsely assumed that V1 would wait for him to pass. Associated factors (for V1) included conversation with passengers, an exterior distraction, inadequate surveillance, and a false assumption.

V1, a 1992 Ford Probe, was entering the northbound lane one of a 5 lane, 2 way, without a positive barrier, urban roadway from an entrance ramp with a yield sign.  V2, a 1999 Ford Windstar minivan, was northbound in lane 1 of the 5-lane roadway passing by the entrance ramp.  At the time of the crash, the bituminous roadway was dry, it was dusk but lighted and there were no adverse weather conditions.  Lane 1 is wider at the point of the merge but there is not a full width merge lane present.  While merging, V1, left, contacted V2, right. \n \nBoth vehicles were towed.  No injuries were sustained by the occupants of either vehicle.\n\nComplete interviews and inspections were obtained for both vehicles.\n\nNo mechanical defects were detected for V1.  The driver of V1 was cited in the crash.  She was familiar with the vehicle and properly licensed for it but not so familiar with the roadway.  She had just left the dentist and was in pain and taking pain medication.  She was not in a hurry and, though she denied being fatigued, had experienced sporadic sleep habits in the days prior to the crash from a recent illness and the dental problems. There did not appear to be any evidence of excessive speed or aggressive driving on her part.  Pre-crash movement for V1 was merging.  This vehicle\'s Critical pre-crash event was traveling over the lane line on the left side of travel.  The critical reason was coded to this vehicle for an illegal maneuver (failure to yield), trying to merge into an occupied lane.\n\nNo mechanical defects were detected for V2.  The driver was familiar with both the road and the vehicle.  She also had driven less than 30 minutes at the time of the crash.  She was properly licensed for the vehicle and was not cited.  There were no indications of excessive speed, fatigue, aggressive driving or drug use being involved on her part.  The movement of V2 was going straight.  The Pre-crash event was other vehicle encroachment from the entrance to a limited access highway and a Critical event was not coded to this vehicle.\n  \nAlcohol use by either driver was not found to be a factor in the crash.

The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two-way, two-lane road at the point where the road is oriented to the south just prior to a curve to the east.  Conditions were dark, unlit, and foggy in the hour before daylight.  The wet bituminous road had a posted speed limit of 64kph (40mph).\n\nThis is a Y intersection where the north/south road intersects the road that curves to the left running north/south to east/west. The crash took place at the base of the curve as it met the straight road heading north/south.  This road was controlled by a stop sign, with an advance warning sign alerting drivers to the presence of the stop sign, prior to the intersection.  This road also had a posted speed limit of 64kph (40mph).\n\nV2, a 1999 Jeep Cherokee, was traveling straight south (eastbound) on the road just approaching the curve to the left, in a line of vehicles slightly spread out.  The driver of V2, a 35-year old male, saw headlights coming out of the dark, right in front of him, with no time for avoidance actions. \n\nV1, a 1991 Pontiac Grand Prix driven by a 43-year old male, was northbound on the north/south road.  V1 stopped at the stop sign, looked for on-coming traffic from the north and westbound traffic coming from his right, and proceeded to go straight through the intersection, intending to cross the eastbound lane and travel westbound.  The driver of V1 stated that as far as he could see, it was clear before he went.  He also stated that due to the fog, he apparently could not see far enough ahead.  The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the eastbound lane and pushed V2 toward the westbound lane. \n\nV3, a 2004 Ford Taurus, was traveling straight, approximately 50 feet behind V2, driven by a 28-year old male.  When V1 struck V2, and V2 came to a stop in the road partially in the westbound lane, the driver of V3 braked, with full ABS application, and tried to swerve to the right to avoid V2.  The front left of V3 struck the back right of V2.  V3 then attempted to travel to the right of V2 to avoid further damage, but V1 came to rest in the eastbound lane partially on the roadside, directly in the path of V3.  The front left of V3 struck the left front and passenger area of V1.  V1 was pushed to final rest facing northeast off of the road on the west side by V3. \n\nV1 was towed from the scene due to damage.  The driver of V1 was restrained with a lap and shoulder belt. The driver, who was 6\' tall and weighed almost 300 pounds, contacted and bent the steering wheel and was transported with incapacitating injuries to a local trauma center.  The Critical Precrash Event coded for V1 was this vehicle traveling crossing over (passing through) intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as \xe2\x80\x9cfog\xe2\x80\x9d weather - related factor.  The driver of V1 was wearing his prescription glasses, and had existing health conditions, which required him to take medications for cholesterol, blood pressure, sugar, and attention deficit disorder.  The driver mentioned past family concerns and current work stress, but felt that emotionally he was feeling better than he had in a long time.  The driver of V1 was familiar with his vehicle and with the roadway, and had a valid license.  \n\nV2 came to rest slightly into the oncoming lane of traffic facing southeast, near the point of impacts.  V2 was towed from the scene due to damage.  The restrained driver was transported to a local trauma center, with moderate injuries.  The Critical Precrash Event coded for V2 was other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction over right lane line.  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle.  The driver of V2 was healthy, was taking no medications, did not need corrective lenses, and has no emotional, sleep, or work-related concerns.  The driver of V2 was familiar with both the vehicle and the road, and the vehicle had no mechanical defects.  V2 had numerous tools in open crates in the cargo area of the Jeep, which were found scattered throughout the interior during the inspection.  There were no mechanical defects found during the vehicle inspection.\n\nV3 came to rest just off of the road on the west side and was drivable from the scene after the crash.  The restrained driver of V3 was not reported as injured, and the airbags did not deploy.  Although the other motor vehicle was stopped in the lane, the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to V3, as this vehicle was not involved in the first harmful event.  V3 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions of V2, described by the driver as 50\' ahead of him in the fog, but the Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle, as this was a secondary impact.  The 2004 Ford Taurus was a loaner, which the driver had picked up two days prior to the crash.  The driver had been driving passenger cars for 12 years and seemed familiar with the type of vehicle and the roadway.  The driver wears required lenses to correct a myopic condition, but has no other emotional, health, work or sleep-related issues.  The driver was holding a cup of coffee in his right hand while steering with his left hand.  He is properly licensed, and based on the vehicle inspection, V3 had no mechanical defects contributing to the crash.\n

The crash area is a junction of two interstate highways, where the east/west roadway merges to the northbound leg of the north/south roadway.  The eastbound collector lane is straight, and the westbound ramp curves right, to combine briefly as one two-lane road, before the right lane ends and the road then merges with the northbound highway.  Both the ramp and the collector lane are one-way.  The crash occurred at the point where the ramp combines with the collector as a two-lane road, with a paved right shoulder without rumble strips, and a concrete barrier wall on the left dividing the collector road from the main north/south highway.  At the time of the crash it was a cold, clear weekday evening, and the dark and unlit, bituminous roadway was level and dry.  The posted speed limit on the highway is 105km/h (65mph) with no other posted speed signs for the ramp or the collector lane.  Advisory merge signs are posted at the entrance to the ramp, indicating that the right lane will merge to the left.\n\nV1, a 1995 Ford Club Wagon, driven by a 50 year-old male, was eastbound on the highway and had exited the ramp on a left hand curve and was traveling straight on the collector lane to the northbound highway.\n\nV2, a 1996 Mercury Sable, driven by a 23year-old female, was westbound on the highway and had exited and was traveling on the right hand curve on the ramp to the northbound highway.   V1 reached the combined 2-lane collector ahead of V2, but V2 was traveling at a higher rate of speed.  As V2 moved into the straight portion of the road where it merged with the collector lane from the eastbound ramp, V2 lost control and left the roadway on the right.  V2 rotated counterclockwise and returned to the roadway where the right front of V2 struck the right back of V1.  \n\nV2 continued across the traffic lane and the front of V2 struck the concrete barrier wall on the left and continued to rotate counterclockwise striking the wall again with the left back.  V2 continued to rotate until it came to final rest facing southeast in the right hand lane.  V2 was towed from the scene due to damage.  The driver of V2 was transported to a local trauma center due to injuries.\n\nV1 spun off to the right following the impact with V2. V1 rotated clockwise and continued in lane one in a lateral yaw with the left side leading.  The lower left side of V1 contacted the leading edge of a metal guardrail on the right shoulder. V1 became airborne, striking the guardrail with the left driver\'s greenhouse area.  V1 rolled over 4 quarter turns with the left side leading contacting the ground and came to rest on it\'s wheels facing southeast.\n\nThe unbelted driver of V1 was ejected from the vehicle.  The front left, front right, and back left windows were all broken out during the crash, and the upper portion of the windshield was separated.  All of the doors of V1 remained closed.  V1 came to rest against a tree (app. 30cm in diameter), causing damage to the upper left passenger area.   V1 sustained moderate intrusion to the driver\'s area and was towed from the scene due to damage.  The driver of V1 was treated with life support at the scene and transported to a local trauma center where he was pronounced dead.\n\n\nA witness to the crash was traveling on the eastbound highway and had exited and was traveling on the collector lane to the northbound highway.  The witness observed V2 out of her right peripheral vision, seeming to be traveling too fast to safely negotiate the ramp to the collector lane without striking the concrete barrier wall.  The witness observed V1 ahead of V2 traveling at a lower rate of speed. The witness did not observe any braking or steering/swerving precrash by V1.  The witness vehicle braked and came to rest one foot away from V2 at final rest, which was facing backwards in the right hand lane. The witness also stated that the pavement was dry, and there was no precipitation at the time of the crash, although it began to rain/snow shortly thereafter.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for V1 was \'other motor vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane-same direction over the right lane line\'.  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle.  It is unknown whether there were any Contributing or Associated Factors for this driver.  He was familiar both with his vehicle and with the roadway, and had been driving for 34 years.  There did not appear to be any vehicle related defects at the time of inspection.  The driver was alone in the vehicle, driving his regular commute home after work.  The police did not indicate any alcohol or drug use, but the medical examiner\'s report is pending.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for V2 was \xe2\x80\x9cthis vehicle loss of control due to traveling too fast for conditions\xe2\x80\x9d on the curved ramp.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo fast for curve.\xe2\x80\x9d   V2 lost control at the end of the curved ramp causing her to leave the roadway on the right.  The driver of V2 most likely corrected the vehicle to the left resulting in the counterclockwise yaw.  V2 then re-entered the roadway and struck V1.  It is unknown what the Contributing or Associated Factors for the driver of V2 might have been.  She was driving her own vehicle, on a local highway route near her home.  The driver has a medical history of rubber band surgery for frequent shoulder dislocations.  The driver indicated that she drinks alcohol socially and denies illicit drug use.  The driver lists only birth control pills for prescription medication.  The police accident report indicates that the driver holds a valid driver\'s license.  Although the report listed a Hazardous Action of \xe2\x80\x9cCareless/Negligent Driving\xe2\x80\x9d there were no citations issued in the crash.

V1, a 2004 Kia Rio 4dr sedan, was southbound in lane 4 (the inside lane of 2 left turn lanes) of a 6 lane, bituminous, urban roadway intersecting a 5 lane, urban roadway at a controlled intersection.  V1 was making a left turn on a green arrow onto the 5 lane roadway to go eastbound.  V2, a 2002 Ford Ranger Pick-up, was stopped in lane 3 (the left turn lane) of the 5 lane urban roadway facing west, the first car in that lane, waiting for his own green arrow to turn left.  V2 saw the southbound traffic turning left toward him and, being experienced with that intersection, started to back up knowing that this traffic sometimes cuts the corner too sharply.  V1 cut the corner too sharply and crossed into the lane occupied by V2.  V1, front, contacted V2, front, in lane 3 of the east-west roadway.\n  \n  Both vehicles were towed from the scene.  Neither driver was reported as injured.  Complete Interviews and vehicle inspections were obtained for both vehicles.  Alcohol or illegal drug use were not factors in this crash.\n\n  The driver was found to be familiar with the roadway and the vehicle as well as being properly licensed for that vehicle.  He was an experienced driver with the only restriction on his license being that the vehicle he is operating must be equipped with power steering (which it was). He was not late or in a hurry and speed did not seem a factor.  There were no indications of fatigue or a medical condition contributing to his actions and he was not cited in the crash.  The driver suffers from cerebral palsy and takes various prescribed drugs daily but they were not believed to be contributing factors to the crash.  The vehicle inspection yielded no indications that the mechanical condition of the vehicle contributed to the cause of the crash.  The pre-crash movement of V1 was turning left at the intersection, the critical pre-crash event was over the lane line on the left side of travel and the critical reason was poor directional control e.g., failing to control vehicle.  He was turning left in the inside of 2 left turn lanes which had a lane line that was supposed to separate and guide them through the left turn.  This dotted white line was found to be badly worn and hardly visible.\n\n  A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection was obtained for V2.  The driver was found to be both familiar with and properly licensed for his vehicle.  He was also familiar with that roadway/intersection, traversing it daily.  He was not late or in a hurry being only 1 mile from his destination.  There were no indications of fatigue, medical or mental conditions as being contributors to the crash.  The driver was not cited in the crash.  The vehicle inspection yielded no indications of mechanical problems with the vehicle.  The pre-crash movement was backing up (in left turn lane), the critical pre-crash event was other vehicle encroachment from crossing street turning in opposite direction and the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.  This vehicle had not encroached into the intersection  before backing up but knew that turning traffic cut the corner of his lane many times while turning so tried to back up when he saw them coming.\n  There were no indications of alcohol or illegal drug use on the part of either driver.

The crash occurred on a rural two-way, two lane, gravel/slag road on a clear weekend afternoon.  The road was mostly ice-covered, and contained potholes and ruts, which ran longitudinally down the center portion of the roadway.  The road was straight and had a negative 4.9% grade.  The unposted speed limit was 89km/h (55mph).\n\nV1, a 1997 Saturn 4-door sedan, was traveling eastbound.   The 15-year old unlicensed driver was traveling at a reduced speed (56km/h 35mph), but lost control of V1 due to ice on the roadway.  V1 began to slide to the right in a clockwise rotation, and the driver began to tap lightly on the brakes and steer to the left.   V1 then began to rotate counterclockwise, and the driver steered to the right.  V1 left the roadway on the left side and the front of V1struck a 30cm diameter tree 1.6 meters north of the road edge.  The top 5 meters of the tree broke off at impact and fell on the roof of the vehicle.  V1 came to rest on the road facing north, in the westbound lane.  \n\nThe driver and passenger airbags deployed in the impact. The driver and two passengers were transported to a local trauma center due to injuries.  The vehicle was towed from the scene due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when she lost control of her vehicle due to poor road conditions.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as "Too fast for conditions," a decision error. The driver was cited by police for \xe2\x80\x9cspeed too fast.\xe2\x80\x9d Associated factors coded to this driver include distraction in the form of conversation - as per the driver, she and her two passengers were talking on a cell phone (that was on speaker mode) to another friend at the time of the crash. The driver of V1 was an inexperienced driver who was unlicensed and not familiar with either the vehicle or the roadway. The driver stated that her mother had taught her everything she knew about driving and that she had been driving for one year. Another associated factor coded to the driver of V1 was "poor directional control" due to her actions after the vehicle began to skid. Finally, the condition of the roadway was also coded as an associated factor - the road was not paved and had longitudinal ruts running down it, along with a multitude of potholes. The roadway was also covered in slush and ice. \n\nThe driver of V1 was wearing contact lenses to correct a myopic condition, and stated that she had no health problems and takes no medication.  There appeared to be no fatigue or emotional factors.  Police did not consider either alcohol or drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.  There were no atmospheric conditions or vehicle defects found to be related to this crash.\n\nIn summary, the crash occurred when the unlicensed and inexperienced driver of V1, who was traveling too fast for the ice-covered roadway, lost control, departed the roadway and struck a tree.  Associated factors included distraction by conversation, driver inexperience, unfamiliarity with the road and the vehicle, poor directional control, and the condition of the roadway.

V1, a 2003 Pontiac Vibe, was eastbound on a two-way, two-lane undivided roadway.  It was the early hours of the weekday morning, dark and unlit.  The statutory speed limit on the level, bituminous, slush covered roadway was 89km/h (55mph).\n\nThe 27 year-old male driver of V1, traveling approximately 64km/h (40mph), noticed an approaching curve to the right and attempted to slow his vehicle.  The driver gently braked on the snowy/slushy road, but encountered an icy patch on the pavement.  V1 began to swerve to the right.  The driver slightly steered left to correct and V1 then began to swerve back and forth.  The driver, conscious of overcorrecting, was continuing to make slight steering adjustments with both hands on the wheel, however V1 began to swerve further back and forth each time.  V1 left the roadway on the right side, skidding longitudinally less than 30 degrees to the right.  The nose of V1 fell over a 90-degree embankment/culvert and V1 rolled two-quarter turns to the right and came to rest on the roof in a creek.  The front row seating area was completely submerged.  V1 sustained damage to the top (00TYDO2). V1 was towed from the scene due to damage.  \n\nThe fully restrained upside down driver of V1 was able to release his seat belt and unsuccessfully attempted to open the driver\'s door. While disoriented due to the position of the vehicle, the dark and the water, the driver then attempted to move to the front right door, but found himself in the rear cargo area and located an air pocket.  The driver then opened the rear hatch and exited the vehicle with the help of a bystander.  The driver denied any injuries.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when he lost control of his vehicle on the curve due to poor road conditions.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as \xe2\x80\x9cEnvironmental/highway related due to the slick icy road.  A contributing factor of \xe2\x80\x9ctraveling too fast for conditions-did not realize caution was required\xe2\x80\x9d was coded because although the driver knew that the road was slick and was attempting to drive at a lower speed, he did not know that there was ice and could not control V1 when he encountered it on the road.  There were no other contributing or associative factors including emotional, physical or medical conditions at the time of the crash.  The driver was not fatigued, and was familiar with both his vehicle and the roadway. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests, and the driver was not issued a citation.  The driver had a valid drivers license with no restrictions or endorsements.\n\nIn summary, the crash occurred when the driver of V1, encountered ice on the slushy road, lost control, left the road on the right side, and rolled/fell over an embankment and came to rest in a creek on it\'s roof.  A contributing factor of \xe2\x80\x9ctraveling too fast for conditions-did not realize caution was required\xe2\x80\x9d was also coded.  There were no associated factors coded for V1.\n

The crash occurred on a two-way bituminous roadway in the early evening hours on a weekday.  The roadway consisted of three lanes with a travel lane in each direction; a center left turn lane, and bicycle lanes between the travel lane and the curb in each direction.  Conditions were dark but lighted, it was lightly snowing, and the straight roadway was snow, slush and ice covered.  The posted speed limit was 56kph (35mph).  \n\nV1, a 2000 Suburu Legacy driven by a 31 year-old male, was southbound on the road traveling up a 3% grade.  The driver slowed behind a bus turning right onto a side street in front of V1.  As the bus turned, the driver of V1 sped up and lost control on an icy section of the road.  The driver attempted to brake and steer the vehicle left to regain control but V1 spun clockwise, crossed the bicycle lane and struck a curb on the right road edge.  The driver steered left and V1 then rotated counterclockwise and crossed the lane edge on the left, the left turn lane and into the path of V2.\n\nV2, a 2002 Ford Focus driven by a 34 year-old male, was northbound on the same roadway when V1 traveled out of control from west to east on the road in front of him.  The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the northbound travel lane, and came to rest facing southwest in the same lane.  V2 rotated to the left and was pushed partially into the bike lane, where it was struck by V3.\n\nV3, a 2005 Mazda 3 driven by a 29 year-old female, was northbound in the lane behind V2, and after V2 spun counterclockwise in front of V3, the front of V3 struck the left side of V2.  V2 came to rest in the northbound bike lane area in the mouth of a commercial driveway facing northwest.  V3 came to final rest in the bike lane facing north.\n\nVehicles 1 and 2 were towed due to damage.  V3 was driven from the scene.  The driver and passenger airbags in V1 and V2 deployed.  Medical treatment of drivers and passengers, all restrained with lap and shoulder belts, was refused at the scene.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was this vehicle loss of control due to traveling too fast for conditions.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as environmental/highway related- slick roads (low friction road surface due to ice).  Contributing factors were coded for the driver of V1. The driver had taken a driver\'s education course in his native country and holds an international driver\'s license obtained 6 months earlier that required passing a written examination for this country.  He was cited for \xe2\x80\x9cSpeed too fast\xe2\x80\x9d in the crash, and it was not clear on-scene if the driver understood that driving slower than the posted speed limit was necessary during poor road conditions.\n\nAnother factor coded for this driver was fatigue as he worked doing research at the university all night and slept 4 hours during the day and described himself as \xe2\x80\x9cfeeling tired today\xe2\x80\x9d.  An associated factor was coded for this driver as he is usually the passenger in the vehicle driving down that road, and only drives it himself monthly.       \n\nThe driver was cited for \xe2\x80\x9cSpeed too fast\xe2\x80\x9d in the crash.  The driver was wearing a contact lens to correct a myopic condition and stated that he was on medication as a preventative measure and also takes Vitamin B daily.  A possible associative factor was coded for his antibiotic, which is preventative for many different infections, and has potential side effects including drowsiness, confusion, dizziness and visual disturbances.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for the driver of V2 was other motor vehicle encroachment from opposite direction-over left lane line.  The driver of V2 became aware of V1 as it traveled across the lane lines from his left to his right.  The driver braked, but V2 did not slow down prior to impact.  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle.  There were no associated factors coded to V2.  The driver was wearing contact lenses to correct a myopic (nearsighted) condition.  He was taking no medications, was not fatigued, and was comfortable both with his vehicle and the roadway.  The driver reported no emotional concerns and holds a valid driver\'s license.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event was not coded for the driver of V3 because V3 was not involved in the first harmful event.  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle.  A contributing factor of  \xe2\x80\x9cfollowing too closely-did not realize too close to forward vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d was coded for this driver.  Another contributing factor of \xe2\x80\x9chighway/ roadway related-slick surface (low friction value due to ice) was coded to this driver.  The driver of V3 should have realized that due to the road conditions, she should have been driving more than 1.5 car lengths behind V2.  Had the driver of V3 not been following too closely behind V2, she could have stopped her vehicle in time to avoid being part of the crash in the lane ahead of her.  The driver of V3 was taking no medication and reported no health issues, was not fatigued, and was familiar with both her vehicle, which was in good condition, and the roadway.  The driver held a valid license with no restrictions, and there were no indications of emotional or stress related concerns.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.

V1, a 1997 Chevrolet Cavalier 4dr, was southbound in lane 1 of a 2 lane, 2 way, bituminous, straight, rural roadway turning left (east) onto a rural, 2 lane, 2 way, straight, level roadway that turned into a gravel/slag roadway 30meters east of the intersection.  At the time of the crash it was dark, unlit, snowing and the roadways were very snow covered.  As V1 was turning left, it was unable to complete the turn, exiting the eastbound roadway to the right.  The front of V1 struck a tree >10cm.   Both occupants of V1 refused treatment.  V1 was towed due to damage.\n\n    A partial interview and a vehicle inspection were obtained for V1.  The driver was found to be familiar with both the roadway and the vehicle as well as properly licensed for the vehicle.  She had been working, stopped to pickup her child from babysitter\'s and was on her way home, (within a mile of the babysitter\'s), when the crash occurred.  The driver did say that she was not in a hurry but indications are that she was driving too fast for road conditions.  Her sleep and work habits as well as her medical, mental and stress factors are unknown but she was in an extreme agitated state at the scene.  She seemed to be a single mother working full time.  \n\n   A successful download of the EDR was performed.  The vehicle inspection revealed that the air pressure in all for tires exceeded the recommended pressure by at least 20lbs per tire.  Tread depth for each tire was found to be 50 to 60%.  This seemed to be the only mechanical defect found on the vehicle but the vehicle had over 150k miles (241k kilometers) on it at the time of the crash.\n\n  V1\'s movement prior to recognition was turning left, the critical precrash event was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side and the critical reason was attributed to a slick road surface condition.  Associated factors assigned to this vehicle/driver included traveling too fast for conditions, being in a hurry, the snowy weather condition, and an over inflated tire condition. \n\n  The driver was not cited in the crash but was advised that she had been driving too fast for conditions.  The use of alcohol was not involved for this driver.

The crash occurred in the evening hours of a weekday on a four-lane divided roadway.  The road has two lanes in each direction divided by a grassy median.  The vehicles were traveling in the eastbound one-way lanes, where there is an additional left turn lane.  Conditions were dark, unlit and it was snowing.  The straight and level cement road was snow covered in places and the posted speed limit was 80km/h (50mph).  \n\nV1, a 2002 Ford Ranger compact pick-up truck, driven by a 20 year-old female, was eastbound in the right lane slowing to turn right onto an intersecting residential street.  V1 was moving at approximately 10-15 mph with her right turn signal on, checked her rear-view mirror and did not observe any vehicles in the road behind her. The driver then looked forward to begin to turn onto the intended street.  The driver checked her mirror a second time and observed V2 directly behind her.\n\nV2, a 2003 Pontiac Grand Prix, driven by a 36 year-old male, was traveling eastbound in the right lane at a speed of 35-40mph, and the front of V2 struck the rear of V1 in the right lane, just prior to the residential street.  V1 came to rest still facing east with the left side still partially in the right lane in the intersection.  V2 was towed from the scene due to damage.  The fully restrained driver denied any injuries, and the driver and passenger airbags deployed.  \n\nV1 came to rest facing east with the left side in the right lane ahead of V2 at the far side of the intersection.  V1 was towed from the scene due to damage.  The fully restrained driver denied any injuries.  The Critical Precrash event coded for V1 was other motor vehicle in lane traveling in same lane with higher speed.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle.  The driver of V1 used caution driving on the snow covered road and exercised extra caution by checking her rear-view mirror prior to slowing for the turn.  The driver had no health, emotional, or sleep related issues, and was familiar both with her vehicle and with the roadway.  V1 had no mechanical defects upon inspection.  The driver had a valid driver\'s license and the police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for V2 was Other motor vehicle in lane traveling in same direction while decelerating.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event coded for this driver was Inadequate surveillance.  A Contributing Factor coded was roadway related slick surface due to icy conditiol.   By the time the driver of V2 realized V1 was turning, he was already just two car lengths behind her.  The driver of V2 was cited for Speed too fast for conditions.\n                              \nA second Contributing Factor coded to the driver of V2 was fatigue.  The driver of V2 was in an ambulance on-scene and observed by EMS and police to require a Breathalyzer test.  A second police vehicle was called to administer the test.  The driver\'s test results were .00.  The police coded driver fatigue on the Police Accident Report, with no drugs or alcohol, and drove him to his home following the crash with no further testing.  The driver stated that he had spent the 12 hours prior to the crash at a local hospital with his mother who was a patient.  He stated at a later date that he felt rested at the start of the trip the day of the crash, but appeared on scene to be less than fully alert.  An Associated Factor for this driver was that he was operating the vehicle with a suspended Driver\'s License, for which he was cited.  The driver stated that he was not upset, had no concerns, and no emotional or health related issues.  The vehicle was in good operating conditions, and the driver was familiar both with the vehicle and with the roadway.  \n

The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two-way, four-lane divided highway.  The grassy median had metal guardrails only along the bridge supports on either side of the road as it passed under an overpass.  The cement road was level and curved to the left.  It was late afternoon just prior to dusk on a weekday and had begun to snow shortly before the crash, lightly covering the road.   The posted speed limit on the highway was 113km/h (70mph).\n\nV1, a 1994 Isuzu short bed pickup truck driven by a 21 year old male, was traveling east in lane one at approximately 89km/h (55mph) when the back of his truck began to fishtail on the snowy road as V1 came in contact with an icy area.   The driver pumped the brakes and attempted to steer left and right to control the vehicle.  The back of the truck swung to the left and V1 left the roadway on the right side with the left side leading.  V1 traveled laterally in a clockwise rotation down an embankment until the tires dug in and tripped V1 into a rollover as the embankment then began to slope upward.  V1 rolled 4 quarter turns with the left side leading and then rolled back 1 quarter turn onto the driver\'s side as V1 swung around facing back toward the highway and came to final rest. \n\nThe fully restrained uninjured driver of V1 exited the vehicle through the open backlight area.  V1 was towed from the scene due to damage.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for V1 was \xe2\x80\x9cthis vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions\xe2\x80\x9d.   The snow at the time of the crash had not been falling long enough for the driver of V1 (or most others in the area) to adjust his speed accordingly.  The cold pavement, particularly under the overpass, was conducive to creating slippery, icy patches.  The driver\'s stated travel speed was below the posted limit but that was related to evening rush hour traffic.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as \xe2\x80\x9cEnvironmental/Highway related-slick roads (low friction road surface due to ice\xe2\x80\x9d.  A driver decision error was coded for \xe2\x80\x9ctraveling too fast for conditions-did not realize caution was required\xe2\x80\x9d due to the fact that the driver did not recognize the need to slow down as soon as it began to snow.  Although the driver had only been driving the truck full time for a few months, the crash occurred at the end of a record setting winter season of snowfall, possibly indicating more of a decision error than inexperience.\n\nOne possible Contributing Factor for this crash was the 6 x 50# sandbags located in the bed of the compact pick-up truck.  The driver put them in to add weight and they were put in lined up in 2 rows of three from wheel well to wheel well right in the middle of the bed.  The driver described the rear of the truck as spinning out as soon as he hit the icy patch, and then fishtailing/wagging back and forth.  Additionally, another Contributing Factor was coded for the vehicle tires as the driver described the tires on the truck as in poor condition and at inspection the pressure in the rear tires was found to be 19 and 22 pounds per square inch and the tread of all four tires was measured at 3 and 4 32nds of an inch each.\n\nA possible Associated Factor was noted for frequency of driving the road, as the driver stated that he was driving that route home after his first day of work at a new job, but one he held 5 years prior.  Although he was familiar with the road, he had not driven on it in the recent past.  However the roadway environment was similar to most of the highways in the area.  \n\nThe driver of V1 was wearing contact lenses to correct a myopic condition, but indicated no other health related conditions.  The driver has a valid driver\'s license with no endorsements, and was in compliance with his corrective lenses restriction.  The driver does not take any medication, and there were no reported alcohol, illegal drugs, sleep, emotional or distraction factors contributing to the crash.  \n

The crash took place on a five-lane, bituminous, straight, level, dry, urban roadway.  There were two eastbound lanes with the third lane a left turn lane, and two westbound lanes.  At the time of the daylight crash there were no adverse weather conditions.\n\n  V1, a 1999 Chrysler Concorde, was proceeding south out of a commercial (gas station) driveway turning left (east) onto a 5 lane roadway.  This driveway was approximately 60 meters west of a fully controlled intersection.  In order to travel east on this roadway, V1 needed to cross 2 westbound lanes and 1 center turn lane used by the eastbound traffic at the aforementioned intersection.  V2, a 1989 Dodge Caravan, was westbound in lane 2 of the 5-lane east/west roadway.  V2 had just proceeded through the intersection west of the driveway and V2 was traveling at a constant speed.  Traffic was backed up in lane 1 of the westbound lanes so V1 was going between stopped cars in lane 1 to turn left.  \n \nThe Chrysler Concorde (V1) was driven by a 24-year old female that was uninjured in the crash.  She stated that she was in the gas station driveway waiting to turn left onto the roadway.  She looked left and thought she had enough time to turn left onto the eastbound lane.  As she pulled out she got struck in the left side by the other vehicle.  This vehicle was towed due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event was turning left at the intersection and the Critical Reason for the Pre-crash Event was turned with obstructed view, an "other" decision error.  The stopped traffic in lane 1 had motioned her into the roadway and blocked her view of V2.  The driver was found to be familiar with both the vehicle and the roadway as well as properly licensed for the vehicle.  She was not late or in a hurry.  The driver reported that her health was good, was wearing prescribed contacts and had had her normal amount (6.5) hours of sleep the night before the crash.  She had worked 5 days (30hours) since her last day off.  The driver did say she was constantly fatigued, before this short trip (she had been driving <30 minutes) and usually when she awoke.  She also suffers from depression and takes two medications for it, the possible side effects are dizziness, blurred vision, tiredness and sleeplessness.   The vehicle inspection yielded no indications that mechanical defects contributed to the cause of the crash.  The driver was cited for failure to yield to oncoming traffic.\n\nThe Dodge Caravan (V2) was driven by a 34-year old male that was uninjured in the crash.  There were two passengers in the V1 was his wife and the other was his child they were both uninjured.  He stated that he was traveling west on the road to take his child to the hospital for her vaccination.  He was driving in the center lane, lane two.  The driver said that it looked like the other driver was a student and she didn\'t have good judgment when she pulled out in front of him.  He applied his brakes but was unable to stop before he hit V1.  This vehicle was towed due to damage.   \n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event was other vehicle encroachment, from driveway,  turning in opposite direction and the Critical Reason is not coded to this vehicle.  The driver was found to be familiar with both the roadway and the vehicle.  He was also properly licensed for the vehicle and had only driven less than 30minutes on scheduled local trip.  He was not in a hurry and excess speed was not a factor in the crash.  There were no indications of fatigue, medical complications (including vision or hearing) or aggressive driving on the part of the driver.  The only mechanical factor associated with V2 discovered during the inspection was excessive tread wear on all 4 tires but this may not have mattered since the road was dry and the driver had no time to brake substantially before the impact.

The crash occurred in an intersection controlled by a traffic signal on a clear, dry weekend in the late afternoon.  V1, a 1994 Chevrolet Blazer, was traveling northbound in lane one on a three-lane, straight, level bituminous road.  The driver of V1, a 20 year-old female, saw the green light ahead and as she approached the intersection she leaned down to pick up a container of decongestant medicine.  When she looked back up the light was yellow and she decided to go through the intersection, traveling slightly above the posted 56kph (35mph) speed limit.  Traffic was stopped in the westbound left turn lane of the cross street and the driver did not see any vehicles moving near the intersection.\n\nV2, a 2001 Chrysler Sebring, was traveling westbound on a five-lane straight, level, bituminous road in lane two approaching the same intersection.  The traffic signal turned green for V2 so the 28 year-old female driver, moving at about the posted 72kph (45mph) speed limit, proceeded through the light.  The front of V2 contacted the right side of V1 in the intersection.  The driver of V2 saw V1 two seconds prior to the crash and had no time for avoidance maneuvers.  The left side of V2 then struck the right side of V1.  V2 then traveled to the northwest corner where it left the roadway.  The front of V2 struck the cement base (85cm) of a signpost and came to rest with the left side against a utility pole facing northwest.  V2 was towed from the scene due to damage.  The driver and passenger airbags deployed and the fully restrained driver, who was extricated from the vehicle, was transported due to injuries.  The five year-old male and the three year-old female in the rear seat also were transported to a local trauma center.  \n\nV1 rotated counterclockwise to final rest in the northwest quadrant of the intersection facing north.  V1 was towed from the scene due to damage and the fully restrained driver and 25 year-old male in the right front seat were transported due to injuries.  The Critical Precrash Event coded to this driver was \'this vehicle traveling-crossing over (passing through) intersection\'.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as \'a decision error/illegal maneuver\'.  The driver stated that instead of slowing down for the yellow light she decided to go through it, which then turned red as she did so.  An \'internal distraction\' was coded as a Contributing Factor which occurred when the driver leaned over to pick up her medicine, which resulted in her taking her eyes off of the road and the traffic signal.  An additional Contributing Factor was coded of a \'sight line restriction\' because the driver of V1 stated that due to several large vehicles stopped in the westbound left turn lane blocking her view of V2, she did not see V2 until just prior to impact.  Related to this, an associated factor was coded for this driver\'s myopic vision, that she does not have corrective lenses for, although they are not required on her driver\'s license.  \n\nThis driver also was coded for other Contributing Factors of fatigue, as she works 55 hours per week, has young children who \xe2\x80\x9cwear her out\xe2\x80\x9d, and had been moving furniture at home during the week prior to the crash.   Health conditions coded include asthma, allergies and a cold.  Her medications are a prescribed bronchodilator for the asthma, progestin, and an over-the-counter decongestant for the allergies and cold.  Some of the possible side effects for these medications are dizziness, sleeplessness, anxiety, tension, and tremors, which can be increased by the use of some antihistamines.  Finally, the crash occurred the day before a holiday and the driver\'s schedule was filled with a series of short stops in preparation for the next day.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to the driver of V2 was \'other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across path\'.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle.  There were no contributing or associated factors coded for this driver.  She was wearing her required corrective lens, reported no health, stress or emotional concerns and was familiar both with the roadway and her vehicle.  The vehicle had no mechanical defects found during the inspection.  The driver is properly licensed and police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.

The crash occurred in an intersection controlled by an on colors traffic signal, in the afternoon on a clear, dry weekday.  V1, a 1992 Chevrolet Lumina, was southbound on a two-way, four-lane, straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 56kmh (35mph).  V1 was traveling in the left lane approaching three non-contact vehicles stopped to make a left turn at the intersecting road.  V1 changed lanes to the right curb lane and proceeded through the intersection although the signal was amber prior to V1 entering the intersection.  \n\nV2, a 1994 Saturn SL, was northbound on the same road and had stopped on the green light at the intersection for 3-5 seconds, waiting to turn left.  V2, driven by 24 year-old female, accelerated from the stop and proceeded to turn left.  The front of V1, driven by a 47 year-old female, struck the right side of V2 in the intersection.   Neither driver had time for avoidance actions.  V1 came to rest facing south in the southbound curb lane at the southwest corner.  V2 came to final rest facing northeast in the eastbound curb lane just west of the intersection.  V1 was driven from the scene.  V2 was towed from the scene due to damage.  Both fully restrained drivers were transported from the scene to a local trauma center where they were treated and released.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for V1 was Other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction - over left lane line.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded Critical event not coded to this vehicle.  A Contributing Factor coded to this driver was \'other recognition factor of impending problem masked by traffic flow pattern.\'  The non-contact vehicles, coded as a \'sight line restriction,\' in the southbound left lane prevented Driver1 from seeing V2 pulling out from her northbound left lane until she was already in her path of travel.  Another Contributing factor coded was fatigue, as she stated that she wakes up frequently during the night and never gets a good night of sleep.  She reported that she wakes up fatigued every day and felt fatigued at the beginning of the driving trip prior to the crash.  \n\n Associated Factors coded for this driver include health conditions of recurring back problems and asthma, which were not felt to have contributed to the crash.  Prescribed medications are two bronchodilators with possible side effects of dizziness, heart palpitations, shakiness and tremors.

The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-way, two lane bituminous roadway on a clear, dry weekday afternoon.  The straight and level road had a statutory speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph).   A two-way, two-lane road intersected the main road on the left, past the location of the crash.\n\nV1, a 1994 Saturn LS driven by a 17-year old female, was traveling westbound behind V2.  V2, a 2002 Cadillac DeVille driven by a 60-year old female, was following 3 other vehicles when the lead vehicle stopped to turn left at the intersecting road.  The vehicle in front of V2 stopped suddenly.  V2 was able to stop her vehicle safely and check her side and rearview mirrors to see that V1 was approaching quickly.  The driver of V2 noticed that there was no shoulder on the right on which to pull over.  She made sure to stop far enough behind the vehicle in front of her, so if V1 struck her back, she would not hit it.\nThe front of V1struck the back of V2 in the westbound lane, as V2 had almost come to a complete stop.  V2 was pushed forward a short distance following the impact and then pulled forward to a stop in lane one. V2 was driven from the scene of the crash.  The fully restrained driver and the 3-year old female in the back center in a child seat, did not require medical treatment.\n\nThe crash occurred when the driver of V1 looked away from the road while traffic was still moving and reached down to adjust the radio controls.  When the driver looked back to the road, V2 had almost come to a stop in front of her and she had no chance for avoidance maneuvers.  Both air/bags in V1 deployed.  The driver and the right front 17-year old passenger, both fully restrained, did not require medical treatment.  V1 was towed from the scene due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for V1 was \'other motor vehicle in lane traveling in same direction while decelerating.   The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a \'recognition error of internal distraction\' coded for this driver adjusting the radio controls.  Contributing Factors coded for V1 were \'inadequate surveillance for failure to look far enough ahead\', and another distraction because the driver was also having a social discussion with her friend, the right front passenger.  The driver was familiar with both the vehicle, which was in good condition, and the roadway.  She was well rested and was wearing contact lenses to correct a myopic condition, in compliance with a license restriction, and had no health or emotional concerns. The 17 year-old driver had completed a private driver\'s education course and state graduated licensing requirements.  \n\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for V2 was \'other motor vehicle in lane traveling in same direction with higher speed\'.  The Critical Reason was not coded to this driver.  The driver was very attentive to both the road and the surrounding traffic.  Appropriate evasive maneuvers were taken.  Associated Factors for this driver were her menopause medication with a possible side effect of mild dizziness, the fact that she was conversing with her granddaughter in the back seat, and that she was somewhat in a hurry.  She was familiar both with her vehicle, which was in good condition, and the roadway.  There were no health or emotional concerns and she was well rested.  \n\nBoth drivers had valid drivers licenses.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be a factor and ordered no tests.  A citation was given to the driver of V1 for \'failure to stop in assured clear distance ahead\'.\n

V1, a 2003 Ford Focus 4dr, was southbound on a 2 lane, 2 way, rural, straight, level, gravel roadway.  The roadway had just been graded and new gravel applied.  It was daylight at the time of the crash and there were no adverse weather conditions.  V1 lost control on the loose gravel, went into a counterclockwise yaw, exited the roadway to the left (east side of road) and struck a tree >10cm with it\'s front.  The driver was uninjured.  V1 was towed due to damage.\n\n  A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection was obtained for V1.  The crash happened less than 100 meters from the driver\'s residence.  The elderly driver was familiar with the vehicle but had only started driving recently after not driving all winter.  She was familiar with the route but had only driven on the freshly graded/graveled road once when she left home earlier to run an errand.  She was properly licensed for the vehicle was not complying with the corrective lenses restriction at the time of the crash.  Instead she was wearing non-prescription sunglasses.  She was not late or in a hurry but a witness observed that she was going at a high rate of speed when she lost control.  There were no indications of fatigue or medical conditions contributing to the cause of the crash.  The vehicle inspection revealed that all 4 tires were over inflated.\n\n  The vehicle\'s pr-event movement was going straight, the critical pre-crash event was off the edge of the road on the left side and the critical reason was poor directional control e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected.\n\n  Associated factors were possible side effects of medication and driving without prescription lenses.  Contributory factors were that the tires were over inflated and the coefficient of friction for the roadway was reduced due to freshly applied gravel.\n\n  There was no indication that alcohol was involved.  \n

The crash occurred at an intersection on a clear and dry, sunny weekend in the late afternoon.  V1, a 2001 Ford F150 pick-up truck, was southbound on a straight, level, bituminous, two-way, two-lane road with a statutory speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph), controlled by a stop sign at the intersection.  V2, a 2003 Mercury Sable, was eastbound on a two-way, 3 lane, straight, level, bituminous road with a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph), with no traffic control at the intersection.\n\nV1 a 2001 Ford F150 was traveling southbound, he stopped at the stop sign and then proceeded through the intersection.  V2 a 2003 Mercury Sable was traveling eastbound with no traffic control.  V1\'s front hit V2 in the left side.  V1 came to final rest facing southeast on the southeast corner.  V2 rotated counterclockwise following the impact and came to rest facing west on the southeast corner.  \n\nThe 46 year-old male driver of V1 stopped at the stop sign, looked but did not see V2, and pulled into the crossing roadway.  The front of V1struck the left side of V2.  The driver of V1 stated that possibly the two wooden utility poles on the northwest corner might have obstructed his view of the oncoming V2.  The driver saw the other vehicle at the last moment prior to impact and had no time for avoidance maneuvers.  The fully restrained driver denied any injuries in the crash.  V1 was towed due to damage from the scene.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for V1 was \'this vehicle traveling crossing over (passing through) intersection.\'  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as \'recognition error, inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see)\'.  The two wooden utility poles were close together and had a combined diameter of approximately 75 cm.  It was observed during the scene inspection that the poles could completely block the view of a single vehicle as it approached the intersection.  (See scene images)  Further consideration was given to the possibility that the right A pillar of V1 might have contributed to the sight line obstruction.  A Contributing Factor was coded to this driver of a sight line restriction - the two poles.   Had the driver double-checked prior to pulling into the intersection, he would have seen V2.  There were no health, emotional, or stress related conditions attributed to this driver, and he was not taking any medications.  He was not fatigued and was familiar both with his vehicle and with the road.  The driver reported no internal or external distractions.

The crash occurred on a two-way, two lane bituminous roadway with a statutory speed limit of 89 kmh (55 mph).   The conditions were clear and dry on a weekday in the early evening hours.  V1, a 2005 Ford Explorer XLT, driven by a 53 year-old female was eastbound on the roadway negotiating a curve to the right.  The driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel and V1 left the eastbound lane, crossed the westbound lane, and left the roadway on the left side.  V1 crossed the paved shoulder and continued onto grass where the front of V1 struck a metal delineator post and a molded plastic mailbox and post mounted on a 4"x 4" wood post.   V1 went down a short 28% slope into a ditch and back up out again at the edge of a driveway, where it ramped up into the air across the driveway.  V1 continued airborne until the front of the vehicle struck and broke a spruce tree, (9 cm diameter trunk at point of break 150 cm above ground), and then another similar tree, just past the first one.  V1 contacted the ground and continued for a short distance before it became airborne again.  V1 continued on the ground and down an 8% slope where the front right contacted a large tree (95 cm diameter trunk).  V1 then rolled over and the front of V1 struck a small metal fence as it rolled three quarter turns and came to rest on the left side facing southeast.   The driver woke up as V1 was traveling through the spruce trees, and stated that the vehicle seemed to be moving very fast, and she had no opportunity for avoidance maneuvers.  She stated that she was going near the speed limit prior to falling asleep.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to this vehicle was \'this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side.\'   The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a \'non-performance error - driver asleep.\'  The Contributing Factor coded for this teacher/driver was fatigue due to the minimal 3 hours of sleep she had the night before as she was up grading final exams late until 2:30 am.  The driver then was awake at 5:30 am to begin a 12-hour workday.   She stated during the interview that she felt energized at the beginning of the day in anticipation of her last day of exams and final farewells with her students. She felt relaxed at the start of the trip home, but began to feel tired about ten minutes into the drive.  The driver fell asleep five minutes later as V1 was negotiating a curve and left the roadway.  She stated that she had work related concerns in the week prior to the crash, but felt very calm and stress free at the end of the workday.\n\nThe driver has pre-existing health conditions of asthma and allergies, which require medication as, needed.  The driver had not taken any prescribed or over-the-counter medication in the time prior to the crash.  She was wearing her contact lenses to correct myopia and kerataconus (contacts worn to smooth out a pointed cornea), as required on her driver\'s license, which was valid with no endorsements.  \n\nThe Explorer was brand new and had been driven by the driver only that day, although she had fifteen years of experience driving similar size and type of vehicles.  There were no mechanical defects found during inspection.  The 2005 Explorer has Advanced Trac with Roll Stability Control.  V1 rolled as it contacted the large tree with the front right corner as the front left wheel was traveling down a slope.   The driver was familiar with the road as she drives it daily.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.   There were no citations issued in the crash.

The crash occurred on a clear, dry morning in the daylight, on a two-way, three-lane, straight, level, bituminous roadway.  V1 was traveling northbound at approximately 64kmh (40mph) with a posted speed of 72kmh (45mph).  \n\nThe 47 year-old female driver of V1, a 2001 Ford Explorer 4 door, fell asleep as she attempted to turn right into a fast food restaurant driveway.  The driver stated that she had been feeling sleepy throughout her 25-30 minute drive from home to work.  The driver reported that she had been shaking her head and rolling down the window in an attempt to remain awake.  Feeling increasingly sleepy, she decided to pull off of the road and turned approximately 30 meters short of the intended driveway.  The driver stated that she did not remember anything past beginning her turn.  V1 exited the roadway on the right, went up the cement curb, across the grass and the front of V1 struck a <8cm diameter metal post.  V1 front then struck the front and rode up onto the right side of a legally parked unoccupied vehicle in a restaurant parking lot. V1 then rolled into a second legally parked unoccupied vehicle, where it came to final rest facing east with its\' right side wheels on top of the first vehicle.  The vehicle was towed from the scene due to damage, and the fully restrained driver reported no injuries sustained in the crash and did not seek medical treatment. \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to this vehicle was \'this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side.\'  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as \'driver related error-critical non-performance error-the driver was asleep.\'   \n\nA Contributing Factor of \'driver fatigue\' was coded as the driver stated that she had started a new prescribed medication for treatment of Lupus four weeks ago and that it made her tired.  She also has Epilepsy, which requires her to get 8-10 hours of sleep per night, and she did sleep 8 hours the night prior to the crash, but reported that she has felt fatigued upon awakening every day since taking the new medication.  The driver stated that she was certain that she fell asleep and did not have a seizure, as she has only had three seizures in 44 years, and that they were triggered by strobe lights.  She was scheduled to have her prescribed medications evaluated in three weeks.  The medication lists dizziness as a possible side effect.\n\nThe driver\'s physical factors and their related prescribed medications were coded as Contributing Factors.  The driver has a seizure disorder medication and is also being treated for depression with another prescribed medication, both that have possible side effects of drowsiness, tiredness, and dizziness and carry warnings about driving.  The driver also has a severe osteoarthritis condition of her lumbar spine, but had not taken any additional medication for that condition the day of the crash.\n\nThe driver was familiar both with her vehicle and with the roadway and there were no mechanical defects found during the vehicle inspection.  The driver stated that she had no emotional or work related stress or concerns on her mind prior to the crash, but reported that she is going through a divorce and that she is seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist.  The driver stated that she had been \xe2\x80\x9cfalling asleep all the way to work, I kept rolling the window down, felt like falling asleep\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthis condition has happened before\xe2\x80\x9d.\n  \nThe properly licensed driver currently has no restrictions on her driver\'s license but a re-examination will be ordered as a result of this crash.

The crash occurred on a straight, bituminous, 5 lane roadway with an upward 6% slope, with a posted speed limit of 56 kph (35mph).  Conditions were clear on the weekday afternoon. \n\nV1, a 1996 Mercury Tracer driven by a 51 year-old female, was traveling eastbound in the right curb lane between 30-45mph.  The driver of V1 had not been feeling well the day before and went to bed at 1800 hours, then woke up the day of the crash feeling better.  Throughout the morning, however, the driver again began "to not feel right; sleepy, tired and thirsty".  After driving for about 10 minutes, she decided to return home and continued for 15 minutes in that direction, to take prescribed insulin for her diabetic condition, and additional daily medications for high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which she had not taken since the prior morning.  As the driver of V1 approached an intersection with vehicles backed up and stopped at a red traffic signal, the driver lost consciousness, and the front of V1 struck the back of V2 in lane one.\n\nV2, a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, driven by a 25 year-old male, had been stopped for 10-15 seconds at the red light, and had just accelerated to 10mph when the signal turned to green, as V1 struck V2.  The driver of V2 had been looking straight ahead prior to the impact and had no chance to avoid the crash.  The driver continued to look ahead after the impact and successfully avoided contacting the vehicle in front of him. V2 came to rest at an angle to the right against the right hand curb.  V2 was drivable following the crash and the driver denied any injuries.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to the driver of V1 was other motor vehicle in lane traveling in same direction with low steady speed.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event coded was critical non-performance-other physical impairment of the ability to act.   The Contributing Factor coded for this driver was illness-blackout (diabetic related).  The driver routinely takes 9 prescribed medications, but had only taken a pain reliever to alleviate bedtime foot pain the night before and was wearing a narcotic patch for pain the day of the crash.  Possible side effects of these pain relievers are light-headedness, dizziness and sleepiness.  The driver stated in the interview that she knows that she needs to take her medications regularly, particularly the insulin.  The driver of V1 was cited in the crash for Failure to stop in assured clear distance ahead.  V1 was towed due to damage, and the driver was transported to a local trauma center.   \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to the driver of V2 was other motor vehicle in lane traveling in same direction with higher speed.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this driver.

\nThe crash occurred on a rural highway divided by a grassy median with a posted speed limit of 113kmh (70mph) with two lanes in each direction.  The conditions were clear and dry on the straight, level, bituminous road on the weekday afternoon.\n\nV1, a 2003 Volkswagen Jetta, driven by a 23 year-old male, was traveling in the left lane at 75mph with his cruise control on, when a non-contact vehicle in the right lane began to move into his lane.  The driver of V1 braked without lock-up and swerved to avoid contact with the other vehicle and left the roadway onto the paved shoulder.  As V1 contacted the rumble strip on the shoulder, the driver then swerved to the right and re-entered the roadway.  V1 crossed the left and then the right travel lanes and left the roadway on the right side.  V1 traveled down a grassy slope and continued 15 meters until the front of the vehicle struck a tree >10cm in diameter.  V1 came to rest against the tree facing northwest and was towed from the scene due to damage.  The properly restrained driver of V1 denied injuries and did not seek medical treatment.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to the driver of V1 was "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side."   The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a "performance error-overcompensation".  The driver stated in the on-scene interview that had he continued straight on the left shoulder, he most likely could have maintained control and returned safely to the roadway.  He stated that when his tires hit the rumble strip he panicked and quickly steered right and lost control.  A Contributing Factor coded to this driver was "inadequate/incorrect evasive action-chose inappropriate/unsuccessful evasive action".  \n\nThe driver was properly licensed and familiar both with his vehicle and with the roadway.  The driver did not report any emotional, physical or work related issues and was well rested.  There were no mechanical defects found during the vehicle inspection.

The crash occurred on the westbound lanes on a highway with three lanes in each direction, divided by a median barrier wall, at the point where an entrance ramp joins the right lane.   The posted speed limit for the highway is 113kmh (70mph) for cars and 89kmh (55mph) for trucks.  At the time of the weekday afternoon crash, traffic was heavy but moving at close to the posted limit.  Conditions were clear and dry on the straight bituminous road, which sloped >2% upward at the point of impact.    \n\nV2, a 2002 International 9400 truck tractor without a trailer, was traveling in lane one going 89kmh (55mph).  As V2 neared the straight, level, entrance ramp, V1, a 1999 Chrysler Concorde, was traveling on the ramp about to merge onto the highway.  Due to the congested traffic conditions, the 34 year-old male driver of V2 could not move from his position in lane one.\n\nV1, driven by a 37 year-old female, came to the end of the ramp traveling at approximately the same speed as V2.  The left side of V1 struck the right second axle tire of V2, as V1 entered lane one of the highway.  The witness traveling behind the truck stated that at the last second, V1 swerved to the right in an apparent attempt to avoid contact with V2.  The driver of V1 then swerved to the left, and back again to the right at which time V1 spun clockwise and left the roadway onto the right shoulder, and then down a >2% grassy slope.  The front of V1 struck a cement wall which ran parallel to the roadway 12 meters from the shoulder.  V1 rotated counterclockwise and the right side of V1 struck the wall as V1 continued traveling westward.  The front of V1 contacted the wall as V1 rotated clockwise again, and then finally V1 continued to rotate clockwise until it came to rest with the left side against the wall.  In addition to the wall, V1 struck several small trees planted in front of the wall along the 15 meters between impact #2 and impact #5.  V1 came to rest facing northeast and was towed from the scene due to damage.  The driver of V1 was transported from the scene to a local trauma center.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for the driver of V1 was "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of travel lane."  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as \'unknown driver error.\'  The driver refused to give an interview after stating that she works and goes to school full-time and is very stressed and does not have time to talk.  The crash occurred at a freeway entrance ramp near the driver\'s home.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for the driver of V2 was "other vehicle encroachment from entrance to limited access highway".  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this driver. The driver of V2 pulled the still driveable truck over onto the right shoulder following the crash.  The driver reported no injuries.  When interviewed on-scene, the driver stated that he observed V1 on the ramp pre-crash, and tracked its\' movement with his right convex mirror, and thought the driver would slow to merge behind him as his vehicle was partially ahead of hers.  The driver further stated that due to vehicles in lane two, he could not move over to avoid V1, nor did he brake, which may have  resulted in striking V1 with the front of his truck.  The driver stated that he had no safe way to avoid contact with V1.  The driver of V2 had been trained in two truck driving courses, one through a community college and one through the trucking company.  The driver had 18 months experience and had driven V2 more than 10 times and was comfortable driving it with and without trailers.   The driver had dropped his last trailer early in the morning, then slept in the sleeper cab for 10 hours, woke up and had driven 20 miles towards picking up his next trailer when the crash occurred.  The driver had driven on that part of that highway 10 or 11 times.  He held a valid driver\'s license with endorsements for Hazardous Materials, doubles and triples.  The driver was wearing his required corrective lenses.  V2 was inspected on-scene and no mechanical defects were found.  The damage to the truck consisted of slight scraping on a metal splash guard and the right tire on the second axle.\n\nAn Associated Factor was coded to the driver of V2 for possible side effects of sleepiness and disorientation from his prescribed medication for high blood pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

The conditions were clear and dry on the weekday afternoon, on the road posted with a 56kmh (35mph) speed limit.\n\nV1, a 1997 Toyota Camry, was traveling northbound at approximately 15 mph, in lane 2 trying to decide whether to go straight in lane 2 or to get into lane 3 and turn left.  The 25 year-old female driver of V1 decided to turn left at the last minute, switched to lane 3, the left turn lane, and proceeded to turn.  \n\nV2, a 200l Chrysler PT Cruiser, driven by an 84 year-old man, was southbound in lane two approaching the same intersection.  The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the intersection.  The driver of V1 saw V2 approaching but thought that he was far enough away so that she could turn in front of him.  The driver of V1 stated that V2 appeared to be moving very fast, and that he saw her and should have stopped to let her proceed.  The V1 driver stated repeatedly during the on-scene interview that she did not understand why she received a citation for \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to yield right of way\xe2\x80\x9d, when V2 had adequate time to stop and instead hit her.\n\nA witness traveling behind V2 stated that V1 was clearly moving from lane to lane traveling down the road pre-crash, and then moved at the last minute into the left turn lane and turned left right in front of V2.  The witness stated that V2 was traveling about 15-20mph pre-crash, and locked up his brakes trying to avoid striking V1.\n\nV1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to damage.  The front airbags deployed in both vehicles and both drivers were fully restrained.   The driver of V2 was treated on-scene for a slight facial injury and both drivers refused further treatment at the scene.   \n\nThe critical Pre-crash Event coded to the driver of V1 was \xe2\x80\x9cthis vehicle traveling turning left at intersection.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event coded was \xe2\x80\x9cfalse assumption of other road users actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  The driver believed that V2 would stop to avoid a crash.  Contributing Factors coded to this driver are  \xe2\x80\x9cmisjudgment of velocity of other vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d as the driver also thought V2 was traveling slower than he was.  A  \xe2\x80\x9cperformance error-other\xe2\x80\x9d was also coded as the driver has a misunderstanding of a basic driving law that states that traffic turning left must yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.  The driver has had Basic Driver\'s Education and holds a valid license with no restrictions.  \n\nThere were no mechanical defects found during the vehicle inspections.

V1, a 2000 Plymouth Voyager minivan, was traveling westbound on a 2-lane undivided gravel/slag rural roadway. The roadway was dry, straight and level, and was bordered by a 40 cm deep ditch on its south side. There was no posted speed limit on the roadway, which by default in this State was 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred in the early afternoon hours on a clear day. There was a minimum of loose gravel on this portion of the roadway. \n\nThe driver of V1, a 25-year old female, drifted into the oncoming lane for an unknown reason. Once she realized she had done this, she steered hard to the right, driving her vehicle into the ditch on the side of the road. She then attempted to re-enter the roadway by steering left. As V1 began to re-enter the roadway, it rolled over to its right, striking a mailbox in the process. The van rolled over 4 quarter-turns, coming to final rest on its wheels, facing northwest. The driver and her two juvenile passengers were transported, treated, and released. V1 was towed due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for the driver of V1 was when she traveled off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as overcompensation, a performance error. An associated factor coded to this driver was an unknown non-driving activity. As per the police report and the crash investigation, it appears that the driver of V1 became distracted by something and let her vehicle drift into the oncoming lane. Once she realized that this had happened, she jerked the wheel to the right to return to her lane. The driver of V1 denied being distracted; however, this statement was not deemed credible, given the circumstances of the crash.   \n

The crash occurred during the late evening hours on a weekend night at a rural intersection of two undivided two-lane bituminous roads.  The conditions were clear and dry on the summer evening.  The unlighted intersection was controlled by 4-way stop signs and flashing red beacons.\n\nV1, a 2003 Chrysler Voyager minivan, was traveling eastbound on a straight, level road that had no posted speed (by default, 89 kmph/55 mph).  The van was observed by a witness as traveling around 45 mph, flashing its high beam lights and not slowing at all prior to traveling into the intersection without stopping at the stop sign.  V1 was driven by a 35-year old male.\n\nV2, a 2003 Ford F-150 pick-up truck, was northbound on the straight and level, intersecting road.  The driver of V2, a 56-year old male, stopped at the stop sign, and then proceeded into the intersection to turn left, assuming V1 would stop at its stop sign. The front of V2 struck the right front of V1.  V1 rotated clockwise and left the roadway on the northeast corner.  The left side passenger area of V1 struck a stop sign and V1 continued to rotate clockwise, continuing off of the road backwards, coming to rest against a group of pine trees in the front lawn of his home facing southwest.  The driver was transported from the scene due to injuries to a local trauma center, where a blood alcohol test was obtained.  V1 was towed from the scene due to damage.\n\nV2 rotated clockwise following the impact and came to rest in the eastbound lane of the east leg of the intersection facing northwest.  The fully restrained driver of V2 was transported from the scene due to injuries to a local trauma center.  V2 was towed from the scene due to front damage.  \n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event coded to the driver of V1 was "this vehicle traveling crossing over (passing through) intersection."  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as an illegal maneuver. A strong associated factor was the use of alcohol:  the driver of V1 was found to have a blood alcohol level of .205.  Additional associated factors coded to the driver of V1 included a pre-existing medical condition of post-traumatic stress disorder, for which he takes an unspecified antidepressant and an anticonvulsant, and aggressive driving. As per the witness statement, the driver of V1 went through the stop sign while flashing his high beams.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event coded to the driver of V2 was "other motor vehicle encroachment from crossing street across path."  The Critical Reason was not coded to V2. One associated factor coded to the driver of V2 was a false assumption of other road user\'s actions. As per his interview, he stated:  "I must have seen headlights down the road and thought the car would stop at his stop sign, so I pulled into the intersection to turn left."\n\n

Case Summary 2005-11-058\n\nThe crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a limited access highway on a weekend during the day.  The roadway consisted of three lanes in each direction divided by a grassy median with trees and a metal guardrail next to the shoulder.  The road was level and curved slightly to the right and had a posted speed limit of 113kmh (70mph).  At the time of the crash it was raining hard and the well-traveled bituminous road was wet.  \n\nV1, a 2003 Chevrolet Malibu driven by a 33 year-old female, was traveling at approximately 60-65 mph in lane two.  The driver realized that the speed was too fast for the wet conditions and was intending to change lanes to the right, slower lane.  V1 began to hydroplane as non-contact vehicles in lane one and lane three passed V1 at the same time.  The driver of V1 felt her vehicle lose contact with the pavement and begin to swerve to the left, then to the right as driver steered right, and then back to the left again.  V1 left the center lane and rotated counterclockwise across lane three and the left shoulder until the back right of V1 struck the guardrail.  The right front of V1 struck the guardrail and the driver then steered left to avoid contact on the right passenger area where her 12 year-old niece was the front right passenger.  V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest 75 meters down the road in lane three facing east.\n\nThe fully restrained driver and passenger of V1 were transported to a local trauma center.  V1 was towed from the scene due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded for V1 was \'this vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions-puddle/water on road.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as \'decision error-too fast for conditions\'.  An Associated Factor was coded for the driver\'s prescribed hormone medication which has a possible side effect of drowsiness.\n\n\n

\n  V1, a 1995 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, was northbound in lane one of a 2 lane, 2 way street at an intersection controlled by a stop sign.  V2, a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was eastbound in lane 2 of a straight, 4 lane, 2 way, not physically divided, uncontrolled, urban roadway that intersected the street occupied by V1.  V1 attempted to turn left (west) across the path of V2.  V2, front, contacted V1, left.  At the time of the crash it was daylight and the roadway was dry.  V1 came to rest facing west on the westbound roadside.  V2 came to rest in its original lane facing east.  Both drivers were alone in their vehicles, both were injured and transported.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.\n\n  A partial interview and a complete vehicle inspection were obtained for V1.  The driver was found to be driving on a suspended license.  The police would not release the names of the drivers involved until the PAR was completed.  By the time the driver information was obtained for V1 he had fled the area and could not be found.  What is known about his involvement in the crash comes from interviews with the vehicle\'s owner (his ex girlfriend) and a witness to the crash.  The Pre-event movement of V1was accelerating in traffic lane, the Critical Pre-crash event was turning left at intersection and the Critical reason for critical pre-crash event was inadequate surveillance.  Factors contributing to the driver\'s actions include his view to the left being blocked by an eastbound, non-contact vehicle in lane 1 turning right onto his street (and waving him out as he turned), failure to look or misjudged he gap of V2 from his left.  He also \xe2\x80\x9crolled the stop sign \xe2\x80\x9c instead of coming to a full stop before turning left.

The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a rural fully controlled highway, divided by a grassy median with trees. The bituminous roadway had two lanes in each direction with a posted speed limit of 113 kmph (70 mph).  The level roadway curved to the right and had paved shoulders with rumble strips on both sides.  At the time of the crash it was an early weekend morning, daylight, clear and dry.  \n\nV1, a 2005 full-size Chevrolet Silverado pick-up truck, was traveling westbound in the second lane of travel. V1 was driven by a 23-year old male who was returning from a week of working out of state, after driving through the night. The vehicle\'s cruise control was set at 70 mph. As the vehicle began to negotiate a right curve in the roadway, the driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel and V1 departed the roadway to the left in the curve.  The driver woke up when the left wheels of the pick-up departed the paved shoulder.  The driver braked and overcorrected, steering right, and V1 rotated clockwise and re-entered the roadway.  The pick-up truck crossed both lanes and then the right shoulder, skidding in a clockwise rotation before departing the road on the right.  As the truck left the road, its left side was leading (facing north) and moving northwest.  The left back of V1 contacted and bent a delineator post on the roadside and continued down a 25 percent slope, rolling over 7 quarter turns with the left side leading.  V1 came to rest on the passenger side facing north and was towed from the scene due to damage.  The unrestrained adult lying down asleep in the second seat was transported to a local trauma center.  The fully restrained driver and adult male right front passenger sustained minor injuries.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event coded to V1 was "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side."  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as "driver asleep," a critical non-performance error. A contributing factor coded to the driver was fatigue, as the driver had not slept a full night since two nights prior to the crash, and had only taken a 2 hour and 30 minute nap in the truck, which ended 5 hours and 15 minutes prior to the crash.  \n\nAn additional associated factor was work related stress/pressure because the driver had been required to work extended shifts.  The driver and passengers had driven 10 hours to the out-of-state work-site 6 days earlier, and worked 8, 11, 13, 12 and 13.5 hours on the intervening days, for a total of 57.5 hours in five days.  The driver stated that the work was physically tiring and that they were all tired, but drove back because one of the passengers wanted to be home by the afternoon for a social event with his son.  Immediately following the last workday, one of the passengers began to drive back to their home state until the driver took over after his nap.  The driver stopped for a two-minute restroom break 45 minutes (and 57 miles) prior to the crash. The men were not running late and would have arrived home 4-5 hours before the planned activity.  Additionally, the three men were scheduled to be at work the following morning.\n\nAnother associated factor was overcompensation, a performance error. The driver stated that because he was off of the road to the left when he woke up, he immediately jerked the steering wheel to the right and over-corrected, sending the pick-up into a clockwise rotation and off of the road on the right side.\n\nOther associated factors were the driver\'s relative unfamiliarity with the road and with the work truck, which he had only driven that week, as it was his first week on the job, and the driver was not fully comfortable with the vehicle.  In addition, the driver stated that he noticed prior to the rest stop that the truck felt like it had a flat tire and the vehicle seemed to be bouncing, but he found nothing wrong upon inspection.  \n\nThe driver was cited for careless driving.\n\n

\n  V1, a 1995 Chevrolet Lumina APV minivan, was making a boulevard turn from lane 4 of a westbound, 2 lane, and bituminous roadway with 2 left hand turn lanes to cross 2 one-way eastbound lanes of a 4 lane boulevard.  V2, a 2000 International medium/heavy refrigerated, straight truck, was eastbound in lane 2 of the 2 eastbound lanes of the same boulevard.  V1 rolled the stop sign and began to cross the eastbound lanes when the driver of V1 noticed that traffic was backed up across the boulevard.  She hesitated in the intersection instead of proceeding across.  V2 saw V1 enter his lane from his left, steered right and braked.  V2, front, contacted V1, right, causing it to rotate clockwise and slide to a stop on the grass on the southeast corner of the intersection facing west.  V2 rolled onto it\'s left side and slid to a stop on the southeast corner facing south.  At the time of the crash the roadways were dry and it was daylight.  V1 and V2 were towed due to damage.  All three occupants of V1 were injured and transported.  The driver of V2 was uninjured.\n\n  A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection was obtained for V1.  The Pre-event movement of V1 was stopped in traffic lane, the Critical pre-crash event was crossing over (passing through) intersection and the Critical reason for critical pre-crash event was the driver\'s inadequate surveillance.  Some factors contributing to the crash include the driver\'s failure to come to a complete stop and look to the right before crossing the eastbound lanes, her view of the eastbound lanes being blocked by trees in the median of the boulevard as she approached the stop sign, conversing with other passengers while attempting the turn and fatigue from moving/packing just before running the errand.  She had also had her sleep interrupted the night before by pain so had not completed a night of uninterrupted sleep. \n\n  A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection was obtained for V2.  The driver was found to be properly licensed for and familiar with both the vehicle and the roadway.  The vehicle was properly loaded and not overweight.  He was not exceeding the speed limit.  The Pre-event movement of V2 was going straight, the Critical pre-crash event was Other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across path and the Critical reason for critical pre-crash event was not coded to this vehicle.  \n

\n\nThe crash occurred on an entrance ramp to a fully controlled, divided with a positive barrier, urban highway with a posted speed limit of 105 kmh (65mph).  Conditions at the time of the morning crash were daylight, clear and dry on the straight, level, bituminous roadway.\n\nV1, V2, and V3 were all traveling south on the entrance ramp intending to merge into lane one of the southbound road during rush hour traffic.  Two/three vehicles were in the lead, followed by V3 which was in front of V2.  Behind V2 was a non-contact vehicle, which was in front of V1.\n\nThe lead vehicles, unable to merge into traffic, came to a stop at the bottom of the ramp.  V3, a 2001 Toyota Camry driven by a 32 year-old female, and V2, a 2004 Lexus GX470, driven by a 42 year-old male, also stopped safely.  The driver of V2 noticed the vehicle behind him brake successfully but swerve to the right as if to go around V2 on the shoulder, then swerve back to the left and dart swiftly into the highway traffic. \n\nV1, a 2003 Dodge Grand Caravan, driven by a 31 year-old female, was driving about 40mph behind the line of traffic, when the vehicle in front of her suddenly braked, swerved to the right and then to the left and swung into the line of moving traffic on the highway.  The driver of V1 saw V2 stopped in the lane immediately ahead of her, applied her brakes, and the front of V1 struck the back of V2.  The front of V2 was pushed into the back of V3, causing minor damage to both vehicles.  \n\nV1 was towed from the scene due to damage, with the front airbags deployed.  V2 and V3 were drivable following the crash.  The fully restrained drivers of all 3 vehicles, and the 19 month-old passenger restrained in a child safety seat in row two of V1, denied injuries.  \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event code to V1 was \'other motor vehicle in lane, stopped.\'  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event coded was \'driver related error-too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others.\'  \'Inadequate surveillance\' was coded as the driver \'failed to look far enough ahead\', and \'following too closely\' during the rush hour, in heavy traffic.  Also coded was \'false assumption of other road user\'s actions\', because the driver of V1 assumed that the other drivers would continue to proceed.  A Contributing Factor of \'rush hour congestion\' was coded for all 3 vehicles in the crash.\n\n The Critical Precrash Event coded to V2 was \'other motor vehicle in lane traveling in same direction with higher speed.\'  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle.\n\nV3 was not involved in the first harmful event.\n

Summary 087\n\n  V1, a 1997 Ford Crown Victoria taxi cab, was westbound in lane 2 of a straight, level, 5 lane, bituminous, urban roadway.  At the time of the single vehicle crash it was dark but lighted and the roadway was dry.  V1 drifted left across the center turn lane and both oncoming lanes and exited the roadway to the left.  V1, front, struck a utility pole, severing it and came to rest facing west.  The driver called his office and someone came and picked him up so he left the scene and returned when the police and HVA were notified later.  He returned to the scene when requested by police.  He was uninjured but V1 was towed due to damage.\n  A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection was obtained for V1.  The driver was properly licensed for and familiar with the vehicle.  As an employee of a taxi company, he was just returning to his home yard after dropping off a fare 12 miles away.  He was nearing completion of a 12-hour shift that began at 7pm the previous evening.  The driver stated that V1 experienced a mechanical malfunction that caused the vehicle to veer left and that the brakes did not respond when applied.  Inspection of the vehicle did not reveal anything to support this claim.  The Pre-event movement of V1 was going straight, the Critical pre-crash event was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side and the Critical reason for critical pre-crash event was the driver related factor of the driver sleeping, falling asleep at the wheel.  Though the driver denies falling asleep at the wheel, scene evidence does not support his claim but rather indicates a gradual run-off-road with no attempts at avoidance actions.  Factors contributing to the crash include the length of hours that the driver had worked before the crash, the absence of any evasive actions by the driver, the performance error by the driver to maintain proper control over the vehicle and the driver being fatigued at the time of the crash.  After leaving the scene, the driver had gone home and gone to sleep.  Alcohol was not involved.\n\n \n

\n\nThe crash occurred on a two-way, two lane, straight, rural road with an unposted speed limit of 89kmh (55mph).  Conditions at the time of the early morning weekday and dawn crash were clear.  The bituminous road was predominately ice covered.  Interviews were obtained from both drivers and both vehicles were inspected.\n\nV1, a 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt, driven by a 55 year-old female, was eastbound on the road traveling at about 45 mph approaching a railroad crossing.  The driver stated during the interview that she travels this route daily and always brakes and slows to cross the tracks.  As V1 braked and contacted the first set of tracks, the vehicle began to skid and rotate counterclockwise and the driver lost control of the Cobalt.  V1 continued across the second set of tracks and over the centerline into the westbound lane.\n\nV2, a 2001 Chevrolet Express 3500 cargo work van, driven by a 50 year-old male on his way to work, was westbound on the road, approaching the tracks.  While still 30 meters away, the driver, traveling at 35 mph on the icy road, saw V1 lose control and the driver of V2 began to brake.  V2 had slowed almost to a stop in lane 1 just prior to the tracks, when V1 crossed the centerline and the front of V1 struck the front of V2.  \n\nV1 came to rest on the south shoulder facing north.  V2 came to rest on the north shoulder facing northwest.  Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage.  The unrestrained driver of V2 denied injuries.  The restrained driver of V1 was transported from the scene to a local trauma center.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to V1 was \'this vehicle control loss due to traveling too\nfast for conditions.\'  The Critical Reason coded to the driver of V1 was \'Decision Error-too fast for icy conditions.\'  The driver stated that she had driven on the road to drop her son at school and was on her way back down the road, and did not realize the road was icy and that she needed to go slower.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event coded to V2 was \'other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction-over left lane line.\'  The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle.\n

\n\n  V1, a 2005 Chevrolet Aveo 4dr, was westbound in lane 2 of 2 westbound lanes of a bituminous, interstate roadway, having a center median with a positive barrier, curving left.  V1 was overtaking V2, a 2001 Freightliner medium/heavy truck tractor pulling a single semi trailer, in lane 1 of the same roadway.  At the time of the crash it was daylight and the roadway was dry but the shoulders were icy.  As V1 was beginning to pass V2, V2 drifted to the left crossing the line-separating lane 1 from lane 2.  V1 braked and steered left, went onto the left shoulder, lost control on the ice, re-entered the roadway to the right and impacted the left rear wheel of V2\'s trailer with it\'s front.  It then spun clockwise onto the inside shoulder where it struck the median guardrail with it\'s right rear and came to rest on the shoulder facing east.  V1 was towed due to damage.  Neither driver was injured.\n  A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection was obtained for V1.  The driver stated that V2 drifted into her lane just as she was beginning to pass and she had to take evasive actions.  She was properly licensed for and familiar with her vehicle but only traveled on the roadway monthly.  The Pre-event movement of V1 was passing or overtaking another vehicle, the Critical pre-crash event was Other Vehicle Encroachment from adjacent lane (same direction) - over right lane line and the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.\n  A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection was obtained for V2.  The driver only had 2 years experience driving a semi tractor-trailer truck but he seemed very professional and like his job.  I do believe that the reason he tracked the actions of V1 before the impact was because he drifted left out of his lane and quickly checked his side mirror to see if any traffic was there.  The Pre-event movement of V2 was negotiating a curve, the Critical pre-crash event was This vehicle traveling over the line on the left side of travel lane and the Critical reason for critical pre-crash event was the driver\'s performance error of poor directional control.  Factors contributing to the crash may include the roadway\'s curvature to the left coupled with his poor directional control while negotiating it.    \n\n\n  \n

The crash occurred near mid afternoon on a weekday.  \n\nV1, a 1999 Chevrolet Prism 4dr, was westbound in lane 2 of the roadway.  V2, a 1991 Toyota Corolla 4dr was also westbound in lane 2 of the same roadway in front of V1.  V3, a 2000 Ford Focus 4dr, was westbound in lane 2 stopped in front of V2.  V1 changed lanes partially into lane 1 then returned to lane 2.  Traffic in lane 2 was slowing for backed up traffic ahead.  V1\'s front, contacted V2\'s back, as it was slowing to a stop which caused V2 to accelerate forward, then contacting, V3\'s back.\n\nThe Chevrolet Prism (V1) was driven by a 20-year old male who was uninjured in the crash.  He stated that he was in lane 2 looking to move into lane 1 and as he began to move into lane 1 another vehicle speed by him.  To avoid being hit, he swerved back into lane 2 just as V2 was slowing down for traffic.  V1\'s front contacted V2\'s rear.  V1 was driven from the scene with minor damage. \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V1 was when this vehicle traveled over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane.

This crash occurred just after the noon time hour where the entrance ramp from a north/south interstate merges with the eastbound lanes of another interstate.  The ramp had a 5% down hill grade with a 160.9 radius of curvature to the right.  The eastbound lanes were straight and level.  It was lightly raining and the roadways were wet.  The speed for the ramp was posted at 113 kmph (70mph) with an advisory speed of 64kmph (40mph) and the interstate lanes had a speed of 113 kmph (70mph).  As V1, a 1997 Pontiac Grand Am, was negotiating the right curve of the ramp (traveling between 51-60 mph) it lost control and began rotating clockwise.  The driver then attempted to regain control which caused his vehicle to rotate counter-clockwise crossing the two lane lines to the left before contacting the right rear corner of V2, a 2000 Jeep Cherokee. V2 rotated clockwise one complete rotation swerving across three lanes of traffic before coming to final rest off the road in the ditch on the south side of the interstate.  V1 after contacting V2 rotated clockwise and then contacted the center median wall with the front of the vehicle. Then rotated counter-clockwise to contact the median wall with the right back corner of the vehicle before rolling to final rest in lane two of the interstate.  \n\n           V1 was driven by a 20 year-old male in very good health on his way home from a relative\'s house. The driver stated as he negotiated the down hill curve the rear of his vehicle rotated clockwise and as he attempted to counter steered he lost control of his vehicle crossing all lanes of travel to contact V2 then contacted the center wall of the interstate.  The driver was uninjured and his vehicle was towed due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a driver related error- decision Error, too fast for conditions (too fast on a wet, curved road).  The associated factors were the speed of the vehicle, the wet roads, and low tread depth of the rear tires. \n\n        V2 was driven by a 36 year-old female in good health that was traveling home with the other occupant of the vehicle.  She stated they had been on the road for about 11/2 hours.  She stated that she never saw the other vehicle coming until it was too late and did every thing she could to keep her vehicle under control.  No injuries were suffered and V2 was able to be driven from the scene once it was pulled from the ditch back onto the road.\n\n         The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane (same direction) - over right lane line. The critical reason for the critical even was not coded to this vehicle.

This crash occurred on a 4-lane undivided (2 lanes in each direction) level wet asphalt roadway.  It was nighttime but the road was lighted. The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph).  The driver of V1, who was traveling eastbound in the second lane of travel, stated he had a clear view of the roadway. The driver of V2, who was waiting to exit a driveway located on the south side of the roadway, stated there was a non-contact vehicle that had been traveling eastbound in the first lane of travel, turning into the driveway he was exiting. The driver of V2 reported that he did not see V1 coming from his left until it was too late. V2 pulled out across the eastbound lanes of travel, intending to turn left and travel west. The front of V1 struck the left side of V2. The driver of V2 stated that he took no evasive actions. The driver of V1 stated that he locked up his brakes.\n\nThe driver of V1 was an 18-year old male who reported he was traveling at a speed between 49-67 kmph (31-40 mph) at the time of the crash. He had no related health problems, and had taken no medications prior to the crash.  The driver states he was rested and going to visit his girlfriend.  The driver did not sustain any injuries during the crash. The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when another driver encroached into his lane from a driveway, turning into the opposite direction. The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V1 and he was not thought to have contributed to the crash. He was familiar with both his vehicle and the roadway. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.\n\nThe driver of V2 was a 26-year old male who reported he had no prior health problems and had taken no medications prior to the crash. The driver stated he had stopped but did not see the other vehicle coming.  The driver sustained laceration to his left eyebrow.  He was transported to a local trauma center for his injuries .The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was when he began to turn left at the intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as an \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d recognition error because the sight line for the driver of V2 was blocked by the non-contact vehicle that was in the first eastbound lane (getting ready to make a right turn into the driveway). Because the non-contact vehicle was blocking his view, the driver of V2 did not see V1 and entered the roadway in front of V1.  The driver of V2 also reported that he was in a hurry at the time of the crash, due to his work schedule. He was familiar with both his vehicle and the roadway. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.

This crash occurred at an intersection of two - two-lane, two-way roadways.  V1 was traveling westbound approaching an intersection controlled by a stop sign.  V2 was traveling southbound approaching the same intersection and had the right of way.  The road had a speed of 40 KMPH (25 MPH).  The north, southbound lanes were a level grade and the east west had a -3/122 grade.  Conditions were daylight with cloudy skies and the roadway was wet. The crash occurred in the early afternoon on a weekday.\n\n   V1 a 1986 Chevy pickup, driven by a 43 year-old maile, had slowed for the stop sign, looked both ways, then proceeded to cross the intersection without coing to a full stop.  V2 was approaching the same intersetion and was traveling straight through the same.  V2\'s left fender contacted the front right corner of V1.  V1 rotated counterclockwise facing south in the roadway. V2 after contact proceeded to the southwest corner striking the curb then contacted a tree with the left front corner of the vehicle coming to final rest with the right side of the vehicle making contact to a chain link fence.\n\n   A 21 year-old female, who was later transported to a local trauma center for minor injuries, drove V2, a 1986 Chevy Cavalier.  She stated that she saw V1 approach the stop sign; she assumed the vehicle would stop but it just slowed and did not stop.  She does not remember if she kept her brake on or if she let up on it to try to turn right so she would not make contact to the other vehicle.  She estimated she was traveling 48-56 kmph (30-35 mph) at the time of impact.  There were three other occupants in this vehicle.  The occupant in seat 13 had C-injuries but refused treatment.  The two occupants in the back seat were seat belted but not in child restraint seats; no injuries were sustained.  The vehicle was towed from the scene due to damage.\n\n  The Pre-Event Movement for V1 is going straight.  The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was crossing over (passing through) intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded to this vehicle as a Recognition Error, inadequate surveillance (failed to look but did not see).  An associated factor was this driver was going to a Doctor appointment out of town he reported he was on medication for pulmonary lung disease he refused to state medication he was on for his illness.  Another associated factor is that V1 performed an illegal maneuver by failing to stop at the stop sign by slowing and going.  His vehicle was driven from the scene.\n\n   The Pre-Event Movement for V2 was going straight; the Critical Pre-Crash Event for V2 was other vehicle encroachment from a crossing street, across path.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle.  an associated factor for V2 was that the driver was engaged in a conversation with her back seat occupants at the time of the crash.  The driver of V2 was driving with no license, no insurance, no registration, and no plate onhte vehicle.  Sh also stated she had no driver training.  One child in the back seat was 5 years old the other was 2 years old; neither were in child safety seats.\n\n  The driver of V1 reported that he had stopped for stop sign.  It seems likely that the driver of V1 executed a rolling stop through the stop sign.  He stated that he was late for a doctor\'s appointment at the VA Hospital.

This crash occurred in an intersection at the mouth of an interstate exit ramp. The intersection was level and controlled by a traffic signal that was functioning properly. The exit ramp had a negative slope of 2.5%. The intersecting roadway had a positive slope of 2.5%. It was dry and daylight with clear skies. The speed was 56 kmph (35 mph). \n\nV1, a 1985 GMC Safari, was traveling in lane 4 of a 7-lane roadway. There were four lanes westbound and three lanes eastbound. As V1 approached the intersection he was initially going to turn left; he decided against turning as he was entering the intersection, changed lanes from four to three, and then attempted to go straight through the intersection. V2, a 2005 International Gravel Transport, had exited the interstate and was approaching the intersection intending to go straight. V1 proceeded through the intersection against a red traffic signal.  As the driver of V1 realized he had entered the intersection on a red light he braked and steered right trying to avoid the collision. V2 applied its brakes and the front of V1 was struck by the right side of V2.  After a subsequent side-slap, V1 came to final rest against the northeast curb of the intersection. V2 continued on for anther 400 feet and came to final at the east curb of the roadway.\n\nV1 was driven by a 34-year-old male who was reportedly not injured in the crash.  He offered that he was well rested and was on his way to pick up lunch. He stated that he had slowed to make a left turn but then changed his mind. He further remarked that if he would not of taken evasive actions he would have been contacted in the driver\'s door rather than at the front.  He admitted that he had not seen the light until it was too late to avoid the collision.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 is Crossing Over - Passing Through an Intersection.

He executed an illegal maneuver by failing to stop for a traffic signal.\n\nV2 was driven by a 39-year-old male who was characterized as uninjured. He had only been on the road for about one hour when the crash occurred.  He stated he was decelerating and looking for crossing traffic as he exited the interstate. He further stated that he wears prescription glasses that corrects a Myopic (near sighted) vision. The lenses are photo gray they change in the sunlight.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 is Other Vehicle Encroachment - from crossing street, across path.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded for this vehicle. An associated factor was the driver was wearing glasses that darkened in the sunlight and the truck he was driving was fully loaded with gravel. This load would make it very hard to decelerate or execute any avoidance maneuver.\n\nIt was later learned that the interior of V1 had an intense smell of alcohol. The driver of V1 was also seen at a corner store sitting on curb drinking a 40oz. beer shortly after the crash.  It\'s impossible to determine whether the driver had alcohol in his system at the time of the crash. \n

Due to the long wait time the driver may have gotten impatient.  Additionally, the driver was focused partly on the restaurant he intended to dine at.  That may have become an exterior factor contributing to this crash.  The traffic patterns were askew as well due to construction taking place shortly west of the crash site.\n\nV2, a 2000 Dodge Intrepid, was driven by a 41-year-old female who reported she was on her way to pick up something to eat. She stated that she was in the curb lane and had not moved into lane 2 because the restaurant she was going to was only a few hundred feet past were the crash occurred. She also stated that she honked the horn and was braking and steering right to avoid the crash. She stated her health is good but does have diabetes and takes insulin to correct this condition. She also wears prescription glasses to correct near sightedness. She was wearing her lap & shoulder belt and was not injured in the crash.\n\n The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded other vehicle encroachment - from opposite direction - over left lane line. The Critical Reason for the Pre-crash Event was not attributed to this vehicle.  Two factors present were the driver\'s corrected vision and diabetes condition.

This crash occurred at an intersection on a four-lane undivided (2 lanes in each direction) level, dry asphalt roadway. This crash happened in the late morning hours on a clear weekday. The posted speed was 72 kmph (45 mph).  The driver of V#1 was driving southbound in lane #1. He stated that he had a clear view of the roadway and noted that the road where he wanted to make a left turn was just ahead. The driver of V#1 then changed lanes to the left and decelerated to a stop. V#2 was traveling southbound in lane #2 on the same roadway and its driver stated that V#1 changed lanes in front of him and suddenly stopped. He said that even though he braked hard and steered to the right, there was not enough space for V#2 to stop. V#2 then contacted V#1 in the rear, pushing V#1 through the intersection and rotating V#1 counterclockwise to come to final rest in the second northbound lane of the roadway. V#2 traveled another 40 ft. before coming to final rest in its original lane of travel (lane #2). \n\n    V1, a 1997 Pontiac Montana minivan, was driven by a 77-year old male who reported he was traveling at a speed of 56-64 kmph (35-40 mph) as he was not familiar with the area.

The crash occurred in an intersection joining a roadway containing 4-lanes (2-lanes northbound and 2-lanes southbound) and a roadway containing 4-lanes (2-lanes eastbound and 2-lanes westbound).  The roadway had a -3/122 grade eastbound and a +5/122 northbound grade.  It was daylight and clear and the posted speed was 59 Kmph (35mph). V1 had come to a stop in the second lane of the eastbound lanes traveling next to a non-contact vehicle making a right turn.  This vehicle had a red light.  The driver of V1 thought he had a green light when the driver of the non-contact vehicle made a right turn on the red light.  V1 entered the intersection and V2, which was traveling north in lane 1, entered the intersection and contacted the right side of V1.  V1 rotated clockwise to final rest across the 2 lanes of the east/west traffic.  V2 traveled in the same lane to final rest. The driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital by her mother in a privately owned vehicle.  The driver and passengers of V2 were not injured in the crash.\n\nV1, a 1998 Pontiac Grand Am, was driven by a 28 year-old female who is 25 weeks pregnant and had stated that she had stopped for the red light.  She further added that when the light turned green she entered the intersection.  She saw the other vehicle coming and thought it would stop for the light. \n\nV2, a 1989 Dodge Ram 15-Passenger Van, was driven by a 61 year-old male. He had stated he was transporting 3 female passengers to doctor\'s appointments at the time of the crash.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as This Vehicle Traveling - Crossing over (passing through) intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a driver related factor - illegal maneuver.  The driver of V1 was focused on the vehicle making a right turn and incorrectly assumed that the light had turned green.  The many associative factors for this vehicle include:  driver focused on extraneous vehicle; false assumption of other road user\'s actions; failed to stop for a TCD; took time off from work for doctor\'s appointment that 15 miles away.\n  \nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded as Other Motor Vehicle Encroaching into Lane - Crossing Over and Passing Through Intersection. There was no Critical Reason coded to this vehicle. An associated factor to this driver was he was talking to the passengers of this vehicle. \n\nAn associated factor to V1 was that she was inattentive to the traffic light.  When the vehicle next to her made a right turn on red this driver thought the light was green.  An out-of-town police officer, who witnessed the crash, confirmed that V1 had a red light. \n\nIt was determined that the driver of V1 was driving on a suspended license. The driver of V2 would only give his last name when asked and stated that he would not allow the researcher interview his passengers nor inspect his vehicle.

This crash occurred at an intersection in a rural area. The posted speed limit was 88kmph (55mph). There were two lanes of travel east & west one in each direction. And two lanes of travel north & south. The north & south travel lanes had the stop signs for the intersection with advisory sign\'s stating cross traffic does not stop. The east & west travel lanes slope where level and the northbound lane was a +2%, the southbound lane was +2.5%. It was a clear weekday. V1 had been following another vehicle because he was not familiar with this road of travel. V#2 was traveling west approaching the intersection when V#1 did a rolling stop and continued on into the intersection into the path of V#2. V2 contacted V1 on the left side at the driver door area rotating V1 counter clockwise and then coming to final rest across the ditch on the southwest side of the roadway. V2 rotated counter clockwise coming to final rest facing in the opposite direction on the southwest shoulder of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V#2 was transported to the local trauma unit. The Driver and passenger of V#1 were removed to the state medical examiner\'s office.\n\n          An 84 year-old male that was a fatality in the crash drove V1, a 2000 Buick Regal. Friends of the occupants of V1 that where on scene stated that the driver was in very good health for his age and that he did wear hearing aids at the time of the crash. They also stated that the driver had cataract surgery a year ago so the only time he wears glasses was to read.\n\n           The Critical Precrash Event for V#1 was coded this vehicle traveling: Crossing over (passing through) intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded Recognition Error: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see. An associated factor was that the driver\'s normal road of travel was under construction so he was following another vehicle that was showing him the way around the construction when the crash occurred.\n\n          V2 a 2002 Cadillac Deville was driven by a 71 year-old female, which refused the interview. Her insurance representative contacted me and stated that the driver of V#2 did see the vehicle come up to the stop and slow but not stop. There was nothing she could do to stop or do any avoidance actions.\n\n         The Critical Precrash Event for V#2 was coded Other Vehicle Encroachment: from crossing street, across path. The Critical reason for the critical event was not coded for this vehicle.\n\n          The witness\'s for this case were friends of the driver of V1 the #1 witness was driving the vehicle that the driver (V#1) was following this witness stated that he saw V#2 and knew he had time to cross in front of the west bound vehicle. After crossing he thought of his friend following him. When he looked in his rearview mirror all he saw was dust. He never saw the crash happen.\n\n            The 2nd witness was a very good friend of the occupants of V#1 he helped with the health of the driver and had stated at the scene that this was typical of this driver to not be focused on signs.\n

This crash occurred on a weekend evening on a two-way, two lane roadway. The driver was driving southbound, negotiating a curve when he lost control of the vehicle he was driving. The roadway was dry asphalt. The speed that was posted was 56kmph (35mph) the advisory speed was posted at 48kmph (30 mph) for the curve.  The Slope was level on the roadway and the S. E. was -12/122 to the curve. The vehicle in the crash came to final rest on the east side of the roadway after making contact with a group of trees.\n\n    The Vehicle driven was titled as a 1977 Chevrolet T-Bucket. This vehicle was driven by a 59 year-old male whom was DOA at the scene of the crash. This researcher found that the driver was negotiating a curve in the roadway, the backend of the vehicle lost traction in the curve sliding off the asphalt onto the gravel shoulder. As the driver tried to regain control of the vehicle it came back onto the roadway going across both lanes of travel then leaving the east side of the roadway and shoulder traveling across the grass to contact the front of the vehicle to the trees ejecting the driver at final rest.\n\n    The Critical Precrash Event for this vehicle was coded this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as performance error, overcompensation. This researcher found that this driver was in good health at the time of the crash. His daughter stated that while going through his home after the funeral she found out that he was a boarder line Diabetic. Another associating factor was that the vehicle was not equipped with seat belts. This researcher had found out that this driver lived in the area of the crash at one time and may have been going to visit someone. He knew the roadway very well so this researcher feels the driver may have been speeding at the time of the crash.

\nThe crash occurred on the northbound side of a six-lane interstate. There were three lanes of travel, with one paved median lane with a positive barrier wall on the median side (west side) and a paved shoulder (east side).  This part of the interstate was curved to the right.  The slope was level and it had a super-elevation of  +3/122; the radius of curve was 281.45. The posted speed was 104kmph (65mph).  The roadway was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions. The interstate surface was cement.\n\nAs V1 was negotiating a right curve, the LF tire sustained a \'blow-out.\'  The driver admitted that the tire was repaired two days prior to the crash using \'fix-a-flat.\' As the LF wheel deflated and pulled to the left, the driver responded by overcompensating and steering hard right.  The vehicle traveled over two lanes of travel before departing the roadway and contacting an entrance sign.  The vehicle began to overturn left-side-leading two-quarter turns onto its roof.  The vehicle slid across an entrance lane on its roof before striking a curb, which initiated a third quarter turn almost fully onto its right side; before completely on its right side however, V1\'s wheels and undercarriage struck the inner wall of an overpass.  After striking the wall V1 returned to its roof and slid to final rest.  The driver was treated at the scene and the vehicle was towed due to damage.\n\nA 17 year-old female, who had stated that she was in good health and was not on any medications at the time of the crash, drove this vehicle, a 1996 Saturn SLR. She also stated she does not wear glasses or contact lenses. She stated that she was traveling about 112 Kph (70 mph) and negotiating a right curve on the interstate when she felt the vehicle vibrating very hard and pulling to the right. She stated that she steered back to the left but the vehicle still pulled right. She further offered that, upon realization that she was going to strike a street sign, she again attempted to pull hard left; but after realizing the crash was imminent, she stated that she just held on and closed her eyes.  She also reported that after the crash she initially thought she was entrapped; however, she was able to free herself prior to the arrival of emergency personnel.  \n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as Vehicle Control Loss - Blow Out / Flat Tire; the Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was a Vehicle Related Factor - Tires / Wheels Failed.   An associated factor was that the driver panic and froze after the vehicle began rotating.  She also mentioned that she oftentimes feels fatigued and inexperience could also have contributed to the crash.\n\nReview Note:  There is a conflict between the driver\'s statement and final coding.  The driver states that the vehicle pulled right and she attempted to steer left out of the rotation.  It is believed however that the opposite occurred.  When the LF tire blew out physics dictate that the vehicle will pull left and history shows that drivers, especially inexperienced ones, overcompensate in the opposite direction.  Despite the super-elevation, which was 2.4%, the dynamics involved are indicative of what has been deduced.\n\n\n

\n This crash occurred on a weekday in the late afternoon in the daylight hours. The weather was cloudy. The crash was on a 4-lane 2-way undivided roadway. There were vehicles parked in the curb lane on the either side of the roadway. The posted speed was 48 kmph (30 mph) and the roadway was straight and level. V1, a 1986 Chevy Sport van, was traveling south in the second lane of travel when it departed its lane of travel and contacted the left rear of V2, which was legally parked in the curb lane. V1 then pushed V2 down the roadway and up onto the sidewalk. V1 then contacted V3, another legally parked vehicle, at its left back corner and pushed it onto the sidewalk also. V3\'s final rest was partially on the sidewalk and partially in the curb lane.\n\n               V1 was driven by a 42-year old female who stated that she had taken a medication earlier that should not be taken when driving. She had not planned to drive anywhere that day but had received a call to pick up her son because he had no other way to get home. She also stated that she thought that she could make it to pick up her son and get back home before the medicine "kicked in." As it happened, as she drove south on the roadway, she blacked out. After that she could only recall being told by someone to sit on the curb until EMS got to the scene. She then remembers being in the emergency room at the hospital. She stated that she had been diagnosed as a manic-depressive. She was taking a pain reliever, a muscle relaxant, and a stomach medication. This driver was transported to the local ER for minor injuries. The driver told hospital staff that she had taken a higher dosage of the muscle relaxant medication than was prescribed. V1 was towed due to damage.\n\n               The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on right side of travel lane." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a critical non-performance error - the driver blacked out from medication.

This crash occurred on a four-lane undivided roadway with two lanes in each direction. The crash occurred at a railroad crossing. It was a cloudy weekend afternoon. The posted speed was 56 kmph (35 mph). The pre-crash slope was level, but at the railroad crossing the slope was +3 percent. V#2, a 2001 Chevrolet Lumina, was traveling in lane #2 and slowed for the railroad crossing because of rough roadway. V#1, a 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier, was also traveling in lane #2, following V1. V2 was traveling at a constant velocity and did not realize that V1 was slowing. At the last minute, the driver of V#1 put on the brakes and steered left to avoid hitting V#2; however, the front right of V1 contacted the left rear of V2. Final rest for V#1 was in its original travel lane but slightly over double yellow lines to the left. V#2 was pushed to the right but stayed in its original lane.\n\n       V#1 was driven by a 40-year old female who stated she was not familiar with the area, as she had just moved into the area.  She also stated that she had a habit of looking both ways as she came to any railroad crossing. As she approached this railroad crossing, she looked both to the right and the left, looking for any trains. When she looked back straight ahead, she saw that the vehicle in front of her had slowed almost to a stop. There was no time to avoid the other vehicle. This driver stated that she was in good health - that she wore glasses for reading only and had been diagnosed with anxiety and depression but had not taken her medication that morning. Associated factors coded to this driver include the use of prescription medication, unfamiliarity with the roadway (this was the first time she had been on this stretch of road), and a false assumption of other road user\'s actions, in that she assumed that V2 would continue over the tracks at a normal speed.  \n\n        V#2 was driven by a 49-year old female who had stated she was on her way home from the library and was traveling west on the roadway. As she came to the railroad crossing she had slowed down because the tracks were in bad condition. She also stated that she normally looks in her rear view mirror but for some reason that time she did not. She also stated that she was in fair health. She is diabetic and was diagnosed with breast cancer and had just started chemotherapy. She was taking prescription medications for diabetes and cancer treatments.\n\n    The Critical Pre-crash Event for V#1 was coded: Other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction while decelerating. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as an external distraction. The Critical Pre-crash Event for V#2 was coded: Other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction with higher speed. The Critical Reason for Critical Pre-crash Event was not coded to this vehicle.\n

This crash occurred at an intersection on a weekday afternoon. There were 4 lanes of travel on the north/south roadway (two each direction), and on the east/west roadway there were 2 lanes eastbound and one lane westbound. V2, a police vehicle, was traveling north in lane two with its lights activated but no siren. V2 entered the intersection at the same time as V1, a passenger vehicle traveling east. The front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. V2 then skidded off onto the northeast curb. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest in the center of the intersection. The posted speed was 56 kmph (35 mph) on the east/west roadway (V1) and 48 kmph (30 mph) on the north/south roadway (V2).  There was a properly working traffic light at the intersection. The roadway was level and dry.\n\n           V1, a 1994 Buick Century, was driven by a 19-year old male. He stated that he was traveling east into the intersection on a green light. He also stated that he did not hear or see the lights or siren on the police vehicle. The driver also stated that he was in good health and was not on any medications. He does not wear glasses. This driver reported that he had just picked up the vehicle from a person who said he could have it if he wanted it, and that it would be junked unless he took it out of their yard.\n\n         V2, a 2004 Chevrolet Impala (police vehicle), was driven by a 53-year old male. The surrogate interviewee stated that the driver of V2 was traveling north on the roadway, traveling to a silent dispatch with lights activated, but no siren. He stated that as the driver approached the intersection he did not see the other vehicle due to a vehicle parked on a lawn at the intersection. He also stated that the driver assumed that all traffic would yield the right of way to him.\n\n        The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded: This vehicle traveling - crossing over (passing through) intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see). An associated factor coded to this driver was inattention to the driving task. The driver admitted that he was thinking about the vehicle as he drove it and this was his first time driving it. There was also a sight restriction coded, as there was a non-contact vehicle parked on a lawn at the intersection that partially blocked his view.\n\n        The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded: This vehicle traveling - crossing over (passing through) intersection.  No Critical Reason was coded to this vehicle. Associated factors included the driver of V2 falsely assuming that traffic would yield to him because he was driving a police vehicle with the lights activated, traveling over the speed limit for the roadway, being in a hurry to get to the police call, and a sight line restriction caused by the parked vehicle parked on a lawn near the intersection. \n\nTwo witnesses were interviewed and these witnesses had different views of the crash. One stated that they saw lights on the police vehicle and the other stated that there were no lights.\n\n        This researcher noted that the reconstruction officer used a math formula to mark the spot were each vehicle would have been. Using the assumption that V1 was traveling at 64kmph (40mph) and V2 at 56kmph (35mph), they would have had a clear view of each other. However, using the match with V2 traveling at the EDR reading speed, it would not put them in clear view of each other.  There was a full-size vehicle sitting on the lawn of a home on the southwest corner (for sale) that may have blocked each driver\'s view of the other.  \n

This crash occurred on a curved two-lane undivided roadway. It was a clear weekend afternoon. The crash occurred in a residential area where the speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph). The roadway had a downhill grade of 4 percent, and at the crash scene, the roadway was sharply curved to the left. \n\nV1 was a 1998 Chevrolet Venture minivan driven by a 17-year old male. He reported that he was on his way home from work and was giving a fellow employee a ride to his home. He also stated that he was tired and wanted to get home to rest. He reported that he was in good health, and wore glasses for a hyperopic (far-sighted) condition and was wearing them at the time of the crash. This driver also stated that he is a heavy-footed driver and that he had passed the occupant\'s home. He looked over at the occupant when the occupant was telling him to go down the street to turn around and come back to his house. As the driver of V1 approached the curve, he realized that he was going too fast and he slammed on the brakes while steering left. Even with these actions, the vehicle skidded off the right side of the roadway where the front of the van impacted a utility pole. Post-crash investigation revealed the van\'s odometer to be locked at 53 mph. Both the driver and passenger were transported to a hospital for injuries sustained in the crash. The van was towed due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as too fast for curve/turn. Associated factors coded to the driver were fatigue, inattention, conversation with the passenger, being in a hurry to get home, unfamiliarity with the roadway, and driver inexperience.   \n\n

\n             This crash occurred on an interstate on a weekday evening. The weather was over cast. This crash happened on the southbound side of the interstate just after the merging area of the interstate the speed was posted at 105kmph (65mph) the slope of the roadway was level concrete and dry. As this vehicle tried to merge into lane #1 the drive noted another vehicle merging into its lane.  Then over compensating swerved crossing lane #3 and the median lane making contact to the divider wall braking off the left rear wheel assembly. The vehicle then slid back across the interstate to contact the guardrail on the right shoulder of the roadway coming to final rest at the guardrail.\n\n           The Vehicle in this crash was a 1996 Chevrolet Lumina driven by a 50 year-old female who stated that she is in good health and only wears glasses for reading. She also stated she is taking a thyroid medication. She had stated that she was on her way home from the movies and was merging onto the southbound interstate. She had stated that back where the East and West interstate merged that a non-contact vehicle was not letting her merge and as they came to merge onto the interstate south that she took lane 2 and then stated that she wanted to merge back into lane 1. Looking over her right shoulder saw that the non-contact vehicle was merging into her lane and that was when she pulled her steering wheel to the left so not to make contact to his vehicle. She then swerved to the left across the interstate and hit the center wall.  The vehicle skidded along the wall for a few feet and then it spun around back across the interstate and came to final rest along the guardrail.  \n\n          The Critical Precrash Event was coded: this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was: performance error overcompensation.\n\n         An associating factor was that the witness of the non-contact vehicle stated that he noted the driver and the front of the interior of the vehicle had pop (soda) spilled all over it. He thinks the driver was holding or taking a drink of the pop and didn\'t see that he was braking because of a slower moving vehicle, which caused her to veer to the left.\n

It was dark out at the time of the crash, but the roadway was illuminated. There was a city dump truck parked in lane 2 on the westbound side with its four-way flashers on. Workers were in front of the truck doing water main repairs. There was no driver in the truck at the time of the crash. \n   \n       V1, a 1995 Buick Rivera, was driven by a 58-year old male who was reported to have been intoxicated at the time of the crash. V2 was a 1993 International dump truck that was parked and unoccupied. The driver of V1 was traveling west in lane 2. The front of V1 contacted the rear of V2. The final rest for both vehicles was at point of impact. The driver of the Buick was to have stated to police and paramedics that he had had a few drinks with his friends and he did not see any 4 four-way flashers on the truck. The driver could not be reached for an interview.\n\n     The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as other motor vehicle stopped in lane. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see). An associated factor coded to the driver of V1 was alcohol use - the driver admitted that he had been drinking before the crash. Medical records and the police report also indicated alcohol use; however, the results of the BAC test were not made available. Another associated factor coded to the driver was the fact that this area of the road had recently been set up as a construction zone.\n\n        V2, a 1993 International dump truck, was parked in lane 2 facing west with its four-way flashers on. The driver stated that he had been out of the vehicle for about 2 minutes prior to the vehicle being hit. He also stated that he did not have the amber light on top of the truck activated at that time because the boss was unsure of where he wanted him to place the vehicle. A worker also reported that the trailer hauling the amber arrow (to indicate that drivers should use the adjacent lane) was still parked on the other side of the roadway and was not yet in use. It should also be noted that the rear and sides of the dump truck were completely covered in mud. There was no reflective tape on the back of the truck.\n

This crash occurred on a 4-lane undivided, dry, level roadway (two lanes in each direction) in the northbound lanes. The posted speed limit was 80 kmph (50 mph). The crash happened on a clear, mid-week afternoon. There were no traffic signals at the area of the crash. V1 was traveling north in lane #1 and V2 was traveling north in lane #2 approximately 6 meters (20 feet) behind V1. Suddenly, V1 veered left across the path of V2. V2 then contacted the left side of V1 and then both vehicles skidded across both southbound lanes and off the roadway into a parking lot on the west side of the roadway. The front left of V1 then contacted the right rear of V3, which was parked in the lot on the west side of the roadway. Final rest for V1, V2 and V3 was in the parking lot (this parking lot surface was gravel).\n\n       V1, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, was driven by a 61-year old female who stated that she was looking for a repair shop on her right so that she could set up an appointment to have gas tank repairs done. She also stated that she did not remember turning left in front of V2. She stated V2 hit her in the left side and when they came to final rest they where in the lot on the west side of the roadway. She also stated she was in good health. She does not wear corrective lenses. She did state that she was taking medications but that they do not affect her driving skills. She also stated that she was well rested and felt fine at the start of this driving portion.\n\n       The Critical Pre-crash Event for this driver was coded: this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of travel lane. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as an internal distraction, because it was believed (based on witness statements) that a dog inside of V1 had jumped on the driver of V1 immediately before V1 swerved into the path of V2.  Associated factors coded to this driver include poor directional control, the use of prescription medication, and an emotional condition, as the driver\'s daughter had stated at the scene that her mother had a mental condition. \n\n      V2, a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, was driven by a 50-year old female who stated she was traveling north on the roadway in lane #2 about 20 feet back from V#1, which was in lane #1. She also stated that V1 steered into her lane and she had no time to react. She did not want to steer left to avoid the collision because there was a semi-truck traveling south in lane #2 and she did not want to have a head-on collision with the truck. This interviewee stopped the interview at the health and sleep question part of the interview. \n\n      The Critical Pre-crash Event for this vehicle was coded other vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane (same direction) - over left lane line. The Critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.\n\n    A witness stated that he was standing at the roadside at the time of the crash and saw both vehicles traveling north at about the speed limit. V1 was in lane #1 and V2 was in lane #2. He also stated that a dog had jumped into the lap of the driver of V1 and she then steered left and crossed the path of V2. They had both just missed being hit by a southbound semi-truck. A second witness stated that he did not want to give his name or really get involved but he also saw the dog jump into the lap of the driver of V1. He then turned and ran so he would not be hit.\n\n         V3 was a parked and unoccupied 1991 Chevrolet S-10 pick-up, which only had minor damage to the right box side.\n\n\n

V1, a 2002 Chevy Malibu, was traveling southbound on a 4-lane, two-way, icy asphalt roadway on a downhill grade.  V1 was traveling in the second lane of travel. The driver of V1 stated he thought he might be traveling too fast for conditions.  He tapped his brakes and started to fishtail, rotating in a counterclockwise direction into the oncoming lanes of travel.  V3, a 1999 Sterling tractor-trailer, was traveling on the same roadway traveling northbound, in the first lane of travel.  The driver of V3 stated that when he saw V1 begin to enter the northbound lanes, he tried to get as far over in his lane as possible but could not avoid contacting the right front side of V1.  V3 then departed roadway on the east side and contacted a fire hydrant, a telephone pole and a tree before coming to final rest. After striking V3, V1 rotated back into the second southbound lane of travel, where V2, a 2001 Dodge Ram, was traveling southbound.  The front of V2 contacted the right side of V1.  Both V1 and V2 came to final rest on the roadway. \n\nThe driver of V1 was a 27-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 50-64 kmph (31-40 mph) prior to the crash. He had no health related problems, and had taken no medication prior to the crash.   He was rested and traveling to work. He was wearing his prescribed lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition. He sustained some minor injuries during the crash but refused to be transported to the hospital. \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when he lost control of his vehicle due to his traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as "too fast for conditions." The driver of V1 reported that as he began traveling down the grade of the roadway, he thought he was going too fast and tried to compensate by tapping his brakes. This action then sent his vehicle into a skid.  Associated factors included the speed of the vehicle (too fast for conditions), the slick roadway and the weather (snow).\n\nThe driver of V2 was a 25-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 18-32 kmph (11-20 mph) when he noticed that V1 was losing control.  When he observed V1 skidding toward him, he attempted to slow down further but could not avoid impact.  The driver of V2 was on his way to work.  He had no health problems and had taken no medication.  He was wearing his prescribed lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition. He was not injured during the crash.\n\nNo Critical Precrash Event and no Critical Reason were coded to the driver of V2 because he was not involved in the first harmful event (the impact between the front of V1 and the front of V3). Although he did not contribute to the crash (he took appropriate avoidance actions), two associated factors were coded to him: the condition of the roadway (slick) and the weather (snow).\n  \nThe driver of V3 was a 47-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 34-48 kmph (21-30 mph) prior to the crash.  This driver had history of high blood pressure. He was taking a cholesterol-lowering medication that had no known performance-impairing side effects. The driver was traveling for work and felt rested.  He had only traveled 10 miles before the crash occurred.  He was not injured during the crash. \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V3 was when another vehicle encroached into his lane from the opposite direction, over the left lane line. The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V3 and he was not thought to have contributed to the crash. He took appropriate avoidance actions. Two associated factors were coded to the driver of V3 that were coded to all three vehicles:  the condition of the roadway (slick) and the weather (snow).

V1, a 1995 Buick LeSabre, was traveling southbound on a five-lane undivided roadway (3 lanes southbound, 2 lanes northbound) in the second lane of travel.  The roadway was wet and level.  The crash occurred in the early afternoon hours on a weekday.  V2, a 1986 Dodge Ram pickup, was stopped facing south in the third lane of travel (a left hand turn lane) on the same roadway, intending to turn left at a 4-way signalized intersection.  The Dodge was stopped behind V3, a 1997 Saturn SL1, which was also stopped in the left hand turn lane waiting to turn left at the intersection.  V1 drifted from the second lane of travel into the third and the front of V1 contacted the back of V2.  This impact pushed the front of V2 into the back of V3.  All vehicles came to final rest on the roadway.\n\nThe driver of V1 reported that he had no idea what had happened.  He said that he blacked out just prior to the crash.  The driver had one pre-existing health condition - asthma - but was not on medication.  The driver had been traveling for 10 miles before crash occurred.  He reported only having four hours of sleep the night before.  He was reported as having minor injuries, but refused medical treatment.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was another vehicle was stopped in his lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as "heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act," a critical non-performance error.  This was chosen based on statements given by the driver of V1 to both the researcher and to police.  The driver also admitted that he was fatigued at the time of the crash, he reported that he was in a hurry to get somewhere and that he had been thinking about some personal problems.  Fatigue, being in a hurry, and thinking about personal problems were all coded as associated factors.\n\nThe driver of V2 was waiting behind V3 at the traffic signal, waiting for V3 to complete his left turn so that he could make his own turn.  While stopped in traffic, his vehicle was rear-ended by V1 and pushed into V3.  The driver of V2 was wearing his prescription lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition.  He was not injured.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was another vehicle was in his lane, traveling in the same direction but at a higher speed.  The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V2 and he was not thought to have contributed to the crash.\n\nThe driver of V3 was stopped at a traffic signal in the left turn lane, waiting for the light to change so that he could initiate a left turn when he was struck from behind by V2.  V2 had been pushed into V3 by V1.  The driver of V3 was taking unknown medications for high blood pressure and cholesterol.  He was wearing prescription lenses for a hyperopic (farsighted) condition and was not injured.\n\nNo Critical Precrash Event and no Critical Reasons were coded to the driver of V3 because he was not involved in the first harmful event.  He was not thought to have contributed to the crash.

This crash occurred at a 4-lane 2-way intersection. The crash happened on a weekday around mid-day. The slope was +4/122. The roadway was dry asphalt. The posted speed was 56kmph (35mph). V2 was stopped in lane 2 waiting for oncoming traffic to clear so the driver could make a left turn in the intersection. As V1 approached the intersection the driver was looking for a store address to drop off a product delivery. V1 was about 1 \xc2\xbd vehicle lengths behind V2 the driver of V1 thought V2 had preceded to make its turn. When the driver looked back he was on the back of V2 making contact to the rear of the vehicle. V2 slid into the intersection to final rest. V1 skidded about 10ft. to final rest. A family member took the driver of V2 to the local Trauma Unit after the scene was cleared. \n\n              V1 was driven by a 51 year-old male who stated he was out helping his brother make product deliveries to local stores in the area. He also stated he did not know the area all that well. He stated he was driving on a suspended license for a previous crash. He also stated his health was not that good. He stated he was in the hospital recently for kidney failure, and takes medication for a heart condition, and medication for a nerve condition.\n\n           The Critical Precrash Event for this vehicle was coded: Other motor vehicle in lane other vehicle stopped. The Critical Reason for the critical event was coded recognition error: external distraction. The associated facts were the medications the driver was taking at the time of the crash. Also this driver has a suspended drivers license.\n\n         V2 was driven by a 24 year-old female who stated she was on her way to the day-care to drop off her son 2 year-old that was properly seated in the back right seat of the vehicle. \n\n        The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded: other motor vehicle in lane traveling in same direction with higher speed. The Critical Reason was not coded for this vehicle was not coded.\n\n       This researcher was traveling East on the said roadway about 200 yard back and saw V1 skidding at an angle. Then saw a cloud of dust as I pulled up on the intersection I realized that what I viewed was a crash. I called 911 and then went to see that all persons were ok. The driver of V1 at that time had stated that he did not have a driver\'s license that it had been taken away for a crash that he was responsible for in earlier weeks. He also stated that he had a health problem (mental) but was ok to drive. As I checked on the driver of V2 she stated she was ok but was concerned about her child in the back seat.  After the driver got out to check her child and had a chance to move around then she noted her neck and arms were tingly. At that time I asked her to sit in her vehicle till the police arrived. When the police arrived the officer Stated that the driver of V1 was not to be driving by court order for previous crash.

V1, a 2003 Pontiac Vibe, was traveling westbound on a dry 5-lane undivided (3 lanes westbound, 2 lanes eastbound) asphalt roadway in dark conditions.  V2, a 1997 Oldsmobile Silhouette, was also traveling westbound on the same roadway. The roadway was dry, straight, and level, with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). Both vehicles were traveling in the first lane, with V1 following V2. V2 stopped for a red light at a 4-way signalized intersection.  The front of V1 contacted the back of V2 before coming to final rest on the roadway. Both drivers and the one passenger in V2 were transported to a local trauma center and treated for moderate injuries. \n\nThe driver of V1, a 53-year old female, reported that she was traveling between 31-40 mph.  She was unaware of how the crash had happened.  The police and ambulance reported that the driver might have had a seizure, which may have been the cause of the accident. There was no evidence of any braking on the part of V1. The driver of the V1 had been traveling to stay with family for a few days.  She had traveled for five miles before the crash occurred.  She had a history of cancer and high blood pressure, neither of which seemed to have a factor in the crash.  The driver reported that she felt rested and had no emotional contributors.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when another vehicle was stopped in her lane. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as "heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act," a critical non-performance error. This was chosen based on medical records that indicated that doctors believed the driver of V1 had suffered a seizure while driving and had temporarily relinquished control of her vehicle. Medical records indicated that the driver of V1 had a long history of seizure activity and was taking medication to control this. The seizure medication had the possible side effects of sedation, weakness, and sleepiness. The driver of V1 was also taking three other medications:  a cholesterol-lowering medication, a thyroid replacement therapy medication, and a medication used to prevent osteoporosis. None of these three medications had any known performance-impairing side effects. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests. The driver of V1 was familiar with both her vehicle and the roadway. \n\nThe driver of V2, a 34-year old female, reported that she had been stopped at the red light when the rear of her vehicle was struck by the front of V1.

This crash occurred on a clear weekday afternoon on an undivided 4-lane north/south roadway. The center lanes were asphalt and the outside north/south lanes were concrete. The roadway was level and dry and the posted speed was 72 kmph (45 mph). The crash happened on a long straight section of the roadway with no traffic controls. V1, a 2000 Chevrolet G-series van, was traveling southbound in lane 2. As it traveled down the roadway, the driver drifted across the double yellow centerlines and sideswiped the left side of V2, a 1999 Chevrolet G-series van that was traveling north in lane 2. The driver of V2 saw that V1 was coming across the lines and steered to the right to avoid being struck head-on.               \nV1 continued traveling south in the second northbound lane and struck V3, a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am, head-on. V3 bounced back in its original travel lane and was contacted in the rear by V4, a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am. V4\'s final rest was at its contact point. V3 slid back up to the right side doors of V1. V1\'s final rest was at an angle across Lanes 1 and 2 on the northbound side of the roadway. V2 drove to the next driveway and turned around and came back to the scene.\nV1 was driven by a 66-year old female that had apparently suffered a heart attack while driving south on the roadway. Her husband stated that they where on their way home from the doctor\'s office when the crash occurred. He also stated that the week before the crash the driver had been complaining that her arms were sore and tingly. That was the reason for the visit to the doctor. He reported that before the crash she had been taking no medications at all. He also stated that she was the one who took care of their wheelchair-bound son, lifting him in and out of bed, the tub, etc.             \nV2 was driven by a 32-year old male who stated he was in good health and does not wear glasses or take any medications. The driver stated that he was traveling north on the roadway going to a job site when he noted the southbound vehicle (V1) crossing the centerline. He then steered right so as not to be contacted, but the left rear side of his vehicle was sideswiped by V1. He then turned around in a nearby driveway and returned to the scene of the crash. \nV3 was driven by a 44-year old female who stated that she was in good health but took a medication for thyroid problems. She stated that she had gotten out of work early and was on her way home. \nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was:  this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of travel lane. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a critical non-performance error:  heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act. It was the driver\'s husband\'s belief that the driver of V1 had passed away in the moments before the crash occurred. \n The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction over left lane line. The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V2 and no associated factors were coded to him.\nNo Critical Pre-crash Event and no Critical Reason were coded to the driver of V3 because she was not involved in the first harmful event. Associated factors coded to this driver include fatigue, following too closely, and the use of a prescription thyroid-replacement medication.\n                \n             \n                   \n\n

V1, a 1998 Chevrolet Silverado, was traveling southbound on a wet four-lane undivided (two lanes each direction) asphalt roadway in the second lane of travel.  The roadway was level and curved to the right.  The posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph). It was daylight and had just started to snow.  V1 was intending to go straight and was following behind V2, a 1994 Pontiac Bonneville. V2 was also intending to go straight. The driver of V1 was a 23-year old male. The driver of V2 was a 77-year old female.\n\nA car in front of V2 made a sudden stop.  V2 braked hard in order to avoid contacting the non-contact vehicle.  V1 tried to stop, but could not in time and its right front contacted the left rear of V2.  V2 came to final rest there on the roadway.  The momentum of V1 combined with the offset impact to the rear of V2 sent V1 to the left across the double yellow lines and into oncoming traffic. \n\nV3, a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am, was traveling the northbound on the same roadway in the second northbound lane. V3 was driven by an 18-year old female who claimed that she did not see V1 until the last moment because of the curve.  V1\'s front left contacted the left front of V3.  V3 then spun around 180 degrees and before coming to final rest facing south on the roadway.  V1 also came to final rest facing south on the roadway.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when another vehicle was in his lane traveling in the same direction while decelerating. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as inattention, a recognition error. It was believed that the driver of V1 was not paying attention to what was going on around him and then when V2 began to brake hard, he did not react in time. He admitted that he did not lock up his brakes even when V2 had slowed almost to a stop. For this reason, an associated factor coded to this driver was inadequate evasive action. The driver of V1 reported that he was familiar with both his vehicle and the roadway. He reported that he was not in a hurry and felt rested.  No medical factors contributed to the crash.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests. \n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was when another vehicle was in her lane traveling in the same direction, but at a higher speed. The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V2. At the time of the crash, the driver of V2 was traveling to a doctor appointment.  She reported that she was in a hurry to get there. She stated that she was talking to her passenger in her vehicle at the time of the crash about the passenger\'s illness. She reported that she was upset by recent news she had received.  Although these factors were coded as associated factors, it should be pointed out that the driver of V2 was able to stop in time without striking the non-contact vehicle in front of her that had suddenly stopped. It is possible that her reaction time was delayed, but she was able to avoid the vehicle in front of her. She was wearing her prescription lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition and was taking an unknown heart medication. She reported that she was not fatigued at the time of the crash. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.\n\nNo Critical Precrash Event and no Critical Reason were coded to the driver of V3 because she was not involved in the first harmful event (the impact between the front of V1 and the rear of V2). The driver of V3 was on her way to work and was not in a hurry and not fatigued. She was familiar with both the roadway and her vehicle.  She claimed that she was attentive to her driving but had no time to react to V1 entering her lane due to the curve in the road. She was wearing her prescription lenses at the time of the crash that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition. She was also taking a prescription antibiotic that had no known performance-impairing side effects. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.\n\nIn summary, the crash occurred when the driver of V1, who was inattentive to the driving task, failed to brake in time to avoid striking the rear of V2. This impact redirected V1 to the left, where it entered the oncoming lane of traffic and struck the front of V3.

V1, a 1996 Pontiac Sunfire, was traveling southbound on a four-lane, undivided wet asphalt roadway in daylight conditions. The posted speed limit was 89 kmph (55 mph). The driver of V1, an 18-year old male, intended to go straight through a 4-way intersection with another 4-lane roadway.  V2, a 2004 Chevrolet Silverado with a snow blade and pulling a trailer, was traveling westbound on an undivided four-lane wet asphalt roadway approaching the same intersection. The driver of V2, a 43-year old male, also intended to go straight through the intersection. V3, a 1995 Chevrolet Corsica, was stopped at the intersection facing east waiting to turn left onto the north/south roadway.  V3 was driven by a 55-year old male. V4, a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado, was traveling eastbound approaching the same intersection, intending to turn right. The intersection was controlled by a flashing beacon. North and southbound traffic had a flashing red light; east and westbound traffic had a flashing yellow light. North and southbound traffic was also controlled by stop signs.\n\nThe driver of V1 reported seeing the red light at the last minute and stated that he was traveling too fast to stop in time.  The driver of V1 swerved right to tried to avoid V2 but was unsuccessful.  The front of V2 struck the left side of V1. V1 spun counterclockwise 360 degrees before coming to final rest of the north road edge.  While rotating, the rear of V1 struck the right side of V2.  Following its impacts with V1, V2\'s left front contacted the left front of V3.  The front left of V4 then scraped up the right side of V3.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when he began to cross over (pass through) the intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as an illegal maneuver, a decision error. This was chosen because the driver of V1 admitted that he saw the red light in advance but thought he was going too fast to stop in time. His speed was coded as an associated factor, as was conversation with his passenger. He was also coded as being inattentive to the driving task. The driver of V1 reported that while he was familiar with his vehicle, this was the first time he had driven on this particular roadway. He was wearing his prescription lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition at the time of the crash. He was taking no medications, and police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests. The police did issue a citation to the driver of V1 for failing to stop at a red light. Because it was believed that the driver of V1 intended to go through a traffic control device, he was also coded as driving aggressively.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was when another vehicle encroached into his lane from a crossing street, across his path. The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V2. An associated factor that was coded to the driver of V2 was a false assumption of another road user\'s actions, because the driver of V2 expected that north and southbound traffic would yield the right-of-way to him as he proceeded through the intersection. The driver of V2 reported that he was familiar with his vehicle and that he drove on the roadway approximately once a month. He reported that he was taking a cholesterol-lowering medication that had no known performance-impairing side effects. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.\n\nNo Critical Precrash Event and no Critical Reason were coded to the driver of V3 because he was not involved in the first harmful event (the initial impact between V1 and V2). The driver of V3 was not thought to have contributed to the crash. He was stopped at the intersection waiting for traffic to clear so that he could initiate a left turn. The driver of V3 reported that he took a prescribed medication that had the possible side effect of dizziness and weakness. He also reported that he suffered from sleep apnea but that he was not fatigued at the time of the crash. He was wearing his prescription lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition and was familiar with both his vehicle and the roadway.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.\n\nIn summary, the crash occurred when the driver of V1, who was somewhat inattentive to the driving task, failed to stop for a traffic control device and entered an intersection where V2 had the right-of-way. Associated factors included excess speed, conversation with a passenger, and aggressive driving.

This crash occurred on a four lane two-way roadway. The lanes of travel where north & south, the roadway was level asphalt. The weather conditions where clear, the roadway was dry. The speed was posted at 76 KMPH ( 45mph). Where the crash occurred there was an intersection that was on the east side of the roadway. The roadway was two-lanes in each direction.  V#1 traveling south had stopped to turn left onto an east bound roadway. After sitting stopped for several seconds watching on coming traffic V#1 proceeded to make it\'s turn. There was a non-contact work vehicle parked near the intersection in lane one of the east bound roadway, also as V#1 proceeded to turn, there was another vehicle approaching the intersection traveling west in lane one of the roadway. As V#1 turned it was contacted by V#2 at the right side of the vehicle. V#1 then slid sideways to final rest at the north east corner of the intersection. V#2 after contact rotated clockwise and came to final rest at a south-easterly angle in lane two of the north bound and lane two of the south bound side of the roadway. The driver of V#1 was transported to a local E.R. unit to be looked over for injuries. He stated he was ok. The drive of V#2 was transported to a local trauma unit due to injuries form the crash.\n\n    V1 was a 1992 Chevrolet Pickup driven by a 84 year-old male who is deaf and stated he wanted to decline the interview. The driver had his insurance company call me from out of state to ask about our research and told me she would let her client know it was ok to give me the information about the crash. After several attempts  the drive declined the interview.\n\n     The Critical Precrash Event for V#1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded Decision Error, misjudgment of gap or other\'s speed. An associated factor was that at the time V#1 stopped he may have had time to make his turn there was a non-contact work vehicle parked near the intersection in lane one of the east bond side.  As this driver waited to proceed another vehicle approached traveling west which may have caused hesitation in V#1\'s turn.\n\n     V2 was driven by a 41 year-old female who stated she had just came from the corner store and was traveling north on her way to her husbands place of work. She also stated she had just passed another vehicle and was in lane one when she saw V#1 edging forward to make a left turn onto the roadway to her right (east) and stated she hoped it would not turn. At the last moment V#1 turned, V#2 stated she applied the brakes and turned her head. After contacting V#1 her vehicle spun around not knowing in which direction. The driver stated when the vehicle stopped she crawled away from her vehicle to the curb where a person said to her to lay down he had called for help. The driver stated she thought her vehicle might catch on fire. This driver stated that she is in good health and is not taking any medications at this time. She does not wear glasses.\n\n        The Critical Precrash Event for V#2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction over left lane line. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded for this vehicle. An associated factor to this driver was that she had passed a vehicle in lane two on the right side not giving the driver of V#1 enough time to see her coming. Traveling too fast was coded as an associated factor due to an EDR reading which showed V2 was traveling at 76 mph 5 seconds prior to the impact.\n\n    #1 witness stated he had just turned from his work vehicle in time to see the contact of the vehicles. He stated he then ran hoping not to be hit and when the vehicle came to final rest he ran to the driver of V#2 as she crawled from her vehicle. The west bound non-contact vehicle went to the other driver. He stated he thought both vehicles were traveling at the speed they should of been traveling.\n\n   #2 witness was a husband and wife who state they were west bound coming to the intersection and saw V#1 turning into the street they were traveling. They also stated the V#1 seemed to slow down as he turned. He had stated that they saw the north bound vehicle traveling faster then the speed limit. They had stated that as they checked on the driver of V#1 they found that he was Deaf and they knew sign language so they interpreted for EM\'S persons.

The crash occurred in the morning on a weekday.\n\nV1, a 1997 Chevrolet Venture, was pulling out of a commercial drive and slipped on some ice in the roadway.  V2, a 1991 Saturn was traveling westbound on the same roadway.  She did not see V1 pulling out until he was right in front of her due to a pile of snow on the side of the roadway blocking her view.  The front of V2 contacted the left rear of V1 before coming to final rest on the roadway.\n\nThe driver of V1 was a 26-year old male who had reported that he was stopped before proceeding and was traveling 3-17 kmph(1-10mph).  He did not sustain any injuries from the crash.  The driver of V1 stated that he was pulling out of a driveway to turn left when his car slid on a patch of ice.  He did not see the other vehicle because of the high snow bank that was blocking his view.  The other vehicle hit his vehicle in the left rear and spun him counter-clockwise.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for V1 is this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a recognition error, inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see).  He had no health related problems, and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and coming from the bank.  Associated factors included were the condition of the roadway (icy) and sightline restrictions (snow bank).\n\nThe driver of V2 was a 22-year old female not reported pregnant, who reported that she had been traveling 34-48 kmph (21-30mph).  She sustained no injuries.  The driver of V2 stated that she went through the green light and all of a sudden V1 turned left in front of her.  She could not avoid hitting him.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was other motor vehicle encroachment from driveway, turning into opposite direction.  The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V2 and she was not thought to have contributed to the crash.  She took appropriate avoidance actions.  She had no health related problems, and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  She was rested and taking her mom to work.  She does not have a prescription for corrective lenses.  Two associated factors were coded to the driver of V2 that was also coded to V1 was the condition of the roadway (icy) and sightline restrictions (snow bank).

V1 was stopped in lane three (a left turn-only lane) intending to make a left-hand turn.  V2, a 2005 Buick Lacrosse, was traveling eastbound on the same roadway, in lane two approaching the same intersection intending to go straight.  The driver of V1 stated that she saw V2 with its blinker on and thought that V2 was also going to turn left.  The driver of V1 turned left and the front of V2 contacted the right side of V1 in the middle of the intersection before coming to final rest on the roadway.\n\nThe driver of V1 was a 63-year old female who reported that she had been traveling between 2-16 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash.  She had a history of high blood pressure, and was taking two blood pressure medications, neither of which had any known performance-impairing side effects. The driver of V1 was rested and traveling home from work.  She was wearing her prescribed lenses that corrected both a hyperopic (far-sighted) and myopic (near-sighted) condition.  She sustained minor injuries and was treated on scene.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was "This vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection."  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as a decision error - false assumption of other road user\'s actions, because she assumed that V2 would turn left instead of going straight through the intersection.  \n\nThe driver of V2 was a 38-year old male who had reported that he had been traveling between 82-97 kmph (51-60 mph) prior to the crash.  He also reported that he did not think that the driver of V1 would turn left in front of him because he had the right of way.  He had no health related problems and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and on his way to show a customer the vehicle.  He does not wear prescriptive lenses, and was not injured in the crash.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was "Other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction, over left lane line." The Critical Reason was not coded to the driver of V2.

This crash occurred on a weekday morning just before noon.  There was a light blowing snow.  The roadway was a straight overpass that crossed over the interstate with a .03% uphill grade.  The posted speed was 72 kmph (45mph).  The overpass had a covering of ice.  As V1, a 2004 Chevrolet Tracker, began crossing the over pass it loss control rotating clockwise to the right.  The driver than overcompensated causing his vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and cross the centerline into the path of V2, a 1998 Ford Explorer. V1\'s right side was struck by the front of V2. V2 pushed V1 13m west before V1 struck the concrete barrier and both vehicles came to final rest. \n\n       V1 was driven by a 67 year-old male that was said to have been in good health. The occupant of the vehicle was pronounced dead at the scene and the driver was rushed to a trauma facility where he died a few hours later.   The son-in-law gave the interview but could give very little information as to the nature of the trip but did state that they may have been they may have been shopping or at the local skill center that was just west of the crash scene.  V1 was towed due to damage.\n\n      The Critical Pre-crash Event was coded vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions (ice covered road). The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as an environment related factor, highway related slick roads (low friction road surface due to ice).  The associated factors were the speed the driver was traveling at (did not realize that caution was required) and the steering overcompensation when the driver first began to lose control of his vehicle.  Also the son-in-law indicated that they were planning a large family dinner so the driver\'s thoughts and attention could have been focused on that.\n\n     V2 was driven by a 20 year-old in good health.  He stated that he could see the vehicle approaching from the west loss control and he started to decelerate. When the other vehicle crossed the centerline he states that he applied the brakes wanted to steer off the roadway but there was a bridge abutment to his right.  The driver suffered minor injuries while an occupant suffered non-incapacitating injuries for which he sought treatment for after being released from the scene.  A third occupant left the scene before police arrival with an unknown injury status.  V2 was towed due to damage.\n\nThe critical pre-crash event was coded other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction- over left lane line. The critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle. The associated factors were possible inattention as the driver was conversing with his occupant and inexperience as he rarely drove this road.  Slick, icy roads could have also limited his vehicle\'s stopping ability.

The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to the driver of V1, although alcohol and speed played a factor. Medical records indicated that the driver of V1 had a BAC of .19. Due to his claim that he had no recollection of the crash, it was not known if he took any avoidance actions or if he was distracted in any way prior to the crash.  An associated factor coded to this driver was excess speed - a post-crash inspection of V1 revealed the speedometer to be stuck at 70 mph.\n\nThe driver of V2 was a 40-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 2-16 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash.  He had no health-related problems, and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and traveling to work.  He does not wear prescribed lenses.  He was not injured in the crash.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was when he began to turn left onto the roadway.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was a decision error - misjudgment of gap or other\'s speed, because the driver of V2 thought that he had enough time to pull out onto the roadway.

This crash occurred on a weekend afternoon on a straight, level stretch of roadway with open fields on both sides of the road and a posted speed of 89 kmph (55mph).  The roadway was asphalt covered with blown snow and ice. As V1, a 1996 Plymouth Breeze slowed because of the road conditions it began to lose control and rotate clockwise.  The driver then attempted to regain control by steering left which caused further loss of control as the vehicle began rotating counter-clockwise.  V1 than skidded across the centerline and contacted V2, a 2000 Chrysler Concord.  Both vehicles then side slapped and V1 rotated back clockwise to its final rest in the center of the westbound lane.  V2 rotated counter clockwise and slid off the roadway and came to final rest in the ditch on the north side of the roadway.\n\n           V1 was driven by a 17 year-old female in good health but does wear glasses to correct a myopic (near-sighted) condition.  She stated that her vehicle did not start that morning so a friend offered his vehicle to drive to work.  It was the first time driving this vehicle and she stated it was like riding in a tin can.  She stated she travels this roadway going to work every day and knew that there were snow-covered areas and knew to slow down. She stated that in this area the vehicle felt like it was being pulled in to the snow and she did not want to be pulled into the ditch. She then overcorrected which caused it to skid in the opposite direction and she crossed the centerline where she contacted the westbound vehicle.   She stated that when the vehicles came to final rest she got right out of her vehicle and went to the other vehicle to help the other driver. It was after the EMS and police got to the scene that she realized that she needed to be looked at and was transported to the ER unit.  V1 was towed due to damage.\n\n     The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions (puddle, pot hole, ice, etc.).  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded environment related factor- highway related, slick roads (low friction road surface due to ice, loose debris, any other cause).  The associated factors were that the driver was driving this vehicle for the first time and was uncomfortable with it as well as this driver being young and inexperienced to winter time driving.\n\n         V2 was driven by a 33 year-old female in good health but takes medications for anxiety and tension (which are not believed to have contributed to the crash).  She also wears glasses to correct a myopic (near sighted) condition. She stated that she was on her way to her office to pick up medications for a patient. Then she was to take it back to the patient but never made it to her office. She stated she saw the East bound vehicle sliding in the snow which caused her to slow in hopes that the other driver would regain control of the vehicle.  V1 did not regain control and crossed the centerline and hit her.  She claims not to remember much after that.  She did remember that her car to final rest in a ditch on the side of the road.  She was transported with incapacitating injuries and her vehicle was towed due to damage. \n\n          The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction - over left lane line. The Critical Reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle. The associated factors to this driver were that she may have distracted from the task at hand as she was upset about her patient schedule and that she had to drive back to her office to pick-up medications for her last patient and drive back to the patient home before going back to the office to clock out for the day.\n             \n

This crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a four-lane, one-way, slushy, concrete highway with a positive grade in daylight conditions.\n\nV1, a 2002 Hyundai Elantra, was traveling east bound.  V2 was also traveling eastbound on the same highway.  V1 was attempting to merge into the exit ramp lane when he lost control of the vehicle.   The front of V1 contacted the right side of V2.  V1 then rotated clockwise and contacted the V2\'s rear right side with its left side.  V2 then swiped the concrete barrier with its left side before both vehicles came to final rest on the roadway.\n\nThe driver of V1 was a 16-year old male who had reported that he had been traveling 82-96kmph (51-60mph) prior to the crash.  He had no prior health conditions and had taken no medication.  He was rested and on his way home.  He was wearing his prescribed lenses that corrected a Myopic (near sighted) condition.  He reported that he had hit a patch of ice that caused him to lose control.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was this vehicle loss of control, poor road conditions (icy roadway).  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as Decision Error, too fast for conditions.  The roadway was icy and caution should have been taken.  Another factor in the crash was driver inexperience.  The driver of V1 had reported that he had only been driving one year prior to the crash.  Another factor was that he had not driven this roadway often.\n\nThe driver of V2 was a 58-year old male who had reported that he had been traveling 82-96kmph (51-60mph) prior to the crash. He had a prior condition of high blood pressure, which was not thought to have contributed to the crash. He reported that he usually takes medication for this condition but had not taken prior to the crash.  He was rested and on his way to church.  He was transported to a local trauma facility with minor injuries.\n\nThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was other vehicle encroachment, from adjacent lane (same direction) over left lane line.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded for this vehicle, and he was not thought to have contributed to the crash.  He reported that he did not have time to attempt any avoidance maneuver.\n

This single vehicle crash occurred at a \xe2\x80\x9cT\xe2\x80\x9d intersection between an interstate exit ramp and a north/south roadway.  The ramp and roadway were both level and controlled by a properly working traffic light.  The exit ramp was icy, wet cement.  The intersection itself was partially covered with blowing snow and ice.  The crash occurred as V1, a 1994 Chevrolet Cavalier entered the intersection at a rate of speed too high for conditions.  The vehicle was in lane 1 intending to turn right (north), as the driver applied the brakes and steered right the vehicle slide straight ahead across the northbound lanes contacting a snow bank.   V1 was than redirected across the southbound lanes where it struck a utility pole on the western roadside and came to final rest.\n\n       V1 was driven by a 19 year-old male in good health that was rested and in no hurry. He stated that he was on his way home from a relative\'s.  He claimed he decelerated and steered right as he prepared to turn north. He stated the vehicle slide straight ahead where it contacted the snow bank and then veered to the left crossing the southbound lanes to contact a utility pole on the west side of the roadway. \n\n           The Critical Pre-crash Event was coded this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a decision error, too fast for conditions.  V1 was clearly traveling to fast to maintain control on the end of the ramp that was covered by ice and blowing snow.   The associated factors were the speed the vehicle was being driven at (this could be due to the inexperience of the driver) and the slick surface conditions of the roadway.\n\n\n

This crash occurred at an intersection between a two-way, four-lane roadway that runs north and south and a two-way, two-lane crossing street that is controlled by a stop sign shortly after noon on a weekday.  The roadways were straight, dry, level, and asphalt with a speed posted at 56kmph (35mph).  As V2, a 2000 Chevrolet Tracker, traveled north in lane two; V1, a 1998 Chrysler Sebring was sitting facing West waiting to turn left and travel South.  As a non-contact vehicle in lane one passed the intersection V1 started to make it\'s left turn onto the southbound lanes of the roadway. As it entered the intersection V1 front left corner contacted V2 front right side corner. V2 rotated counter-clockwise slightly to come to final rest alongside V1 facing northwest.  Although both vehicles sat side-by-side they did not side slap after the first impact. \n\n           V1 was driven by a 26 year-old male in good health but he does wear glasses to correct a myopic (near-sightedness) condition. He stated that he had just left a customers home about a block away from the crash and was on his way to another appointment. He was not in any hurry and felt well rested before the crash. This driver also states that he sat at the intersection waiting to turn left for some extra time because of the elevated R/R crossing to his right, which makes southbound traffic difficult to see.  This driver stated that he looked to the right and then left where he saw a white van northbound in lane 1 but did not see the red SUV in lane 2.  He claimed that as the van he had been looking at passed he looked back to the left and started his turn. He saw V2 and applied his brakes but it was too late and he could not avoid the SUV. They both rotated and went towards the northwest corner to final rest.  The driver suffered no injuries and V1 was towed due to damage.\n\n        The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a recognition error- inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see). The associated factors to this crash were the driver preoccupation with the threat of southbound traffic that he could not see as well as his inattention that stemmed from his concern over his an appointment schedule set for the day.\n\n          V2 was driven by a 43 year-old female in good health but does wear glasses for a myopic (near-sightedness) condition.  She stated that her daughter had had a half-day of school so they went for lunch and were now on their way home.  She stated they had driven about \xc2\xbd mile when the crash occurred. She stated that she saw V1 sitting at the stop sign, as it started to move forward her thoughts were that she hoped it would not pull out.  She stated they made contact and rotated to face the North West corner.  Both driver and occupant suffered minor injuries and were not transported.  V2 was towed due to damage.\n\n      The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, turning into opposite direction. The critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle. The associated factor to this vehicle was that the driver was conversing with the passenger just before the crash occurred and may have been inattentive to the roadway.     \n

\n\n            This crash occurred at a 4-way intersection controlled by a traffic signal with a flashing left turn arrow.  There are 3 lanes of travel East & West (1 in each direction and a left turn lane).  The roadway is level in all directions with a posted speed of 80kmph (50mph) eastbound and 72 kmph (45mph) westbound.  As V1, a 2004 Chevrolet Silverado Pickup, approached the intersection and moved into the left turn lane the light turned to green and a flashing arrow for the left turn lane.  V1 sat at a stop for a few seconds waiting to make its turn. While waiting the driver was conversing with his occupants. The driver noted the light had changed to amber. He then started his left turn thinking the through traffic had already turned red. As V1 crossed into V2 (1992 Jeep Cherokee) path V2 contacted V1 at the right front side of the vehicle.  V1 came to final rest facing southwest in the lane 1 at the apex of the southeast corner.  V2 came to final rest in lane 1 of the northbound lanes of the intersection \n\n        V1 was driven by a 58 year-old male who stated he is in good health despite having been diagnosed with diabetes and non-alcohol related cirrhosis of the liver (the driver does take medications for these conditions, but they were not believed to have contributed to the crash). He also stated that he wears corrective lenses for an unknown condition.  The driver claimed he has worked 10 hrs a day without a day off since 11/27/05.  The driver stated he thought the eastbound vehicle had a red light and after starting his turn he had no time to perform any avoidance maneuvers.  The driver of V1 was transported to the local trauma unit. Occupant 2 was trapped and was extricated before being transported to the local trauma unit.  Occupants 3 & 4 were not injured and were released to the family.  V1 was towed due to damage.\n\n     The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The Critical reason for the Critical Event was coded as a driver related factor - decision error, false assumption of other\'s action.  The associated factors were this driver\'s fatigue from long work hours and having had no time off as well as this driver conversing with his occupants, which was a distraction to the driver attentiveness.  The driver also was also unfamiliar with this road as he only driven it rarely. \n\n      V2 was driven by a 23 year-old male that states he is in very good heath and traveling home with his occupant.  The driver stated he looked at he light then to the north of the intersection then as he looked back to look south the vehicle in the left turn lane started his turn. He stated there was no time to do anything but he still tried to steer to the left.  The driver and occupant of V2 were not injured and released.  V2 was towed due to damage.\n \n      The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction-over left lane line. The critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle.  The associated factor was the driver\'s inattention as he was conversing with the occupant as he drove into the intersection. \n\n       This researcher has found that the county road commission had studied the light and has changed the timing of the light as of 1/ 05/ 06.

This crash occurred at an intersection between two five-lane roads controlled by a three color with traffic signal with left turn arrows.  It was a dark but lighted weekday evening and the roadway was wet, level asphalt. The posted speed on the north/south roadway was 72 kmph (45 mph).  As V1, a 1998 Chevrolet Lumina, traveled south in it moved from lane 2 to the left turn lane as it approached the intersection.  The traffic light had gone from a green turn light to a flashing red light.  V1 came to a stop just over the crosswalk lines and waited for a chance to turn.  When the light turned from flashing red to a solid red V1 started it\'s turn. As V1 crossed the northbound lanes of travel it was contacted on the right front side by V2, a 1997 Chevrolet Lumina.  V1 then rotated counter-clockwise coming to final rest facing northwest straddling lanes 1 and 2 of the northbound lanes.  V2 after contact rotated clockwise coming to final rest facing east in the middle of the intersection.  V2 had a fire ignite in the heater core area of the vehicle that was extinguished by a truck driver passing by on a connecting roadway.\n\n        V1 was driven by a 72 year-old male that claimed to be in good health despite having had a quadruple bypass (the medication for which this driver feels does not effect his driving) and presently using a CPAP treatment for sleep apnea.  He also wears glasses to correct a myopic (near sighted) condition.  He had driven two trips out of the area for an auto auction that he works for. He stated after getting gas he was on his way home. He stated that as he drove to the intersection the left turn light had gone from green to red flashing. He stated he stopped just over the crosswalk line and waited for a clearing to turn. He also stated that he did not see the northbound vehicle until after he had started his turn. He stated the vehicle was to close for him to do any avoidance actions.  The driver of V1 was transported to an ER unit by POV (son) while V1 was towed due to damage. \n\n      The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a driver related factor, recognition error, inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see).  The associated factors to this vehicle were that this driver had just made two very long road trips for his place of work and was fatigued.  There was also unknown medication that could of played a factor in the crash even though the driver felt it did not.       This researcher talked to the son of the driver and asked him to talk with his father about his medications and explain that this research and its findings are used for safety.  The driver still stated they played no part in the crash so he felt there was no need to talk about them.\n\n     V2 was driven by a 19 year-old female that states she is in good health and was on her way to a basketball game from work with a friend.  She stated that as she approached the intersection she saw the vehicle in the left turn lane and at the last minute the vehicle started its turn.  She said she applied the brakes and steered right to avoid the crash. After contacting the other vehicle her vehicle rotated clockwise and came to final rest facing the eastbound left turn lane.  The driver was helped from her vehicle by passers-by and her and her passenger were transported to a local trauma unit for injuries.  V2 was towed due to damage.\n\nThe Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction- over left lane line.  The critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle the associated factor to this driver may have been that she may have been conversing with the passenger and she is on a medication for depression.  This medication may affect the driver\'s ability to react to the driving situation.
