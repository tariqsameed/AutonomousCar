\begin{abstract}
The automotive industry is investing billion of dollars in self-driving cars that enable them to perceive the environment and drive the million of miles with range of driving scenarios. The promise of autonomous vehicles is to ensure the safety of roads, pedestrian and reduce the traffic congestion on roads. However, no rules are established yet for the certifying of self-driving car but the Governments are playing supportive role for the encouragement of autonomous car technologies. The intelligent system (car controlling software) must be able to handle the critical scenarios and foresee the environmental cars to avoid any misadventure before the position the cars in the public roads. Virtualization of the test cases in the simulated city (crash scenario) have been introduced to test the car in infinite number of scenarios to unveil the safety bugs. The search based testing techniques to explore parameters for finite cases shows promising result. The intention of the research is generate test cases for simulation of the car crash from Police Report. The direction of the work is to explore meaningful parameter in input scenarios and observed the behaviour of the car to restrict the test cases of crash scenario to interesting and relevant settings.
